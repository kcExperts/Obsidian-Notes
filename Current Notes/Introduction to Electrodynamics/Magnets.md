>[!def|*] Paramagnets
>Materials that acquire magnetization **parallel** to $B$ are called Paramagnets. They are usually attracted to a field $B$.

>[!def|*] Diamagnets
>Materials that acquire magnetization **opposite** to $B$ are called Diamagnets. They are usually repelled away from a field $B$.

>[!def|*] Ferromagnets
>Some materials retain their magnetization even after the external field has been removed. For these, magnetization is not determined by the present field but by the whole magnetic “history” of the object.
