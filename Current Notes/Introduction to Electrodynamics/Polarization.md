#### Background
Now we can answer the question we asked ourselves in the motivation section of [[Dielectrics]]. If the dielectric material consists of neutral atoms, the field will induce a tiny dipole moment pointing in the same direction of the field. If the material is made out of polar molecules, each permanent dipole will experience a [[Torque and Force Produced by Electric Fields|Torque Produced by the Electric Field]]. 

Notice that these two mechanisms produce a lot of little dipoles pointing along the direction of the field, hence the material becomes polarized.

>[!def|*] Polarization
>Under the influence of a field $E$, [[Dielectrics]] produce a lot of little dipoled. We say the material is polarized. We measure this using: $$P \equiv \text{dipole moment per unit volume}$$

From this point forward, we shall ignore why $P$ has gotten there and instead study the field that a polarized material produces.
