>[!definition|*] Spherical Coordinates
>Spherical coordinates can be defined as the following transformation: $$x = rcos(\phi)sin(\theta), \; y = rsin(\phi)sin(\theta),\; z = rcos(\theta)$$
>It is important to note that here $\phi$ is the angle (counter-clockwise angle that wraps around the $xy$ plane) and $\theta$ is the angle that lives on the $z$-axis.

If we consider infinitesimal changes in spherical coordinates, it would be better to represent it in vector form:
>[!definition|*] Infinitesimal Changes in Spherical Coordinates
>If we consider a small change in $dl$ where $dl$ is a change in length, we get: $$dl_r = dr\;\hat{r}, \; dl_{\theta} = rd\theta \;\hat{\theta}, \; dl_\phi = rsin(\theta)d\phi\;\hat{\phi}$$
