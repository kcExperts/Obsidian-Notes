The electrostatic boundary conditions can be recast in terms of $D$.
>[!rmk|*]- Things to recall
>The boundary conditions for $E$ were as follows: $$E^\perp_{above} - E^\perp_{below} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\sigma$$$$E^\parallel_{above} - E^\parallel_{below} = 0$$

Here too, we have our boundary conditions: $$D^\perp_{above} - D^\perp_{below} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\sigma$$$$D^\parallel_{above} - D^\parallel_{below} = 0$$
Remember that $E$ terminates on charges (go away or too charges) and $D$ lines terminate of free charges.

>[!exm|1]
>For the following bar, make three careful sketches: one of $P$, one of $E$ and one of $D$. Assume $L$ is about $2a$.
