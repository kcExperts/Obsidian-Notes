Let us now take a look at the magnetic field $B$ generated by currents.

>[!def|*] Biot-Savard Law
>The magnetic field of a steady line current is given by: $$B(r) = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \int \frac{I \times \hat \tau}{\tau ^2}dl = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} I \int \frac{dl \times \hat \tau}{\tau ^2}$$
>where $r$ is the point and $\tau$ the distance to that point (from $dl$).
>$\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.

>[!rmk|*] Generalization of the Biot-Savard Law
>In surface and volume currents, replace $dl$ with $K$ or $J$ respectively (which are the [[Surface and Volume Charge Density]]). You must of course change the variable of integration as well.

The Biot-Savart law plays a role analogous to [[Coulombâ€™s Law]] in electrostatics.

>>[!claim|*]- Solution
>>By the RHR, it is clear that the magnetic field $B$ will point outside of the page. However, its magnitude will vary as for a segment $dl$, the angle changes with respect to $P$. We recall that the magnitude of the Cross Product is given by: $$||\vec a \times \vec b|| = || \:|\vec a| |\vec b| sin \phi \:||$$Where $\phi$ is the angle formed by the two tails of the vector put together. Since the current $I$ moves towards the right and $\tau$ towards $P$, $\phi$ is given by $\alpha$. Hence the magnitude is: $$dl I \; sin \alpha = dl I \; cos \theta$$Since we want $dl$ in terms of $s$, we rewrite $dl$ as well. Clearly: $$l = s\; tan \theta \implies dl = \frac{s}{cos^2 \theta} \; d \theta$$We also have that $s = \tau cos \theta$, hence: $$\frac{1}{\tau^2} = \frac{cos^2 \theta}{s^2}$$Now we just need to integrate: $$B = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \left(  \frac{cos^2 \theta}{s^2} \right) \left( \frac{s}{cos^2 \theta}\right) \; cos \theta \; d\theta = \frac{\mu_0I}{4\pi}(sin\theta_2-sin\theta_1) $$Which is the desired answer.

>[!rmk|*] An infinite wire
>In Example 1, if the wire was truly infinite, then $\theta_1 = \frac{- \pi}{2} \; \land \; \theta_2 = \frac{\pi}{2}$. Hence: $$B = \frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi s}$$Which should look familiar to any Physics II student.

>Find the magnetic field a distance $z$ above the center of a circular loop of radius $R$, which carries a steady current $I$.

>>[!claim|*]- Solution
>>The field $dB$ attributable to the segment $dl$ points as shown. As we integrate $dl$ around the loop, $dB$ sweeps out a cone. The horizontal components cancel, and the vertical components combine, to give: $$B(z) =\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} I \int \frac{dl \times \hat \tau}{\tau ^2}= \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} I \int \frac{dl}{\tau^2} \; cos \theta$$(See Example $1$ if you are wondering where $cos\theta$ comes from). Clearly: $$\tau^2 = R^2 + z^2 $$Let us also get rid of the $cos \theta$ term: $$cos \theta = \frac{R}{\tau} = \frac{R}{\sqrt{R^2+z^2}}$$Finally, the $dl$ term is trivial. We integrate over a circular loop of radius $R$, hence: $$dl = 2\pi R$$Combining everything together: $$B(z) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}I \left( \frac{R^2}{(R^2+z^2)^\frac{3}{2}} \right) $$

##### Exercises
>[!exercise|1]
>Find the force on a square loop placed as shown below near an infinite straight wire. Both the loop and the wire carry a steady current $I$.

>>[!claim|*]- Solution
>>We do not need to concern ourselves with the segments of the wire in the loop that are perpendicular to the infinite wire as any forces produce will be cancelled by the other side (since each segment $dl$ is at the same height as the other and the current flows in opposite directions). 
>>
>>Now the question says to find the force on the square loop. Thus we will find the magnetic field $B$ produced by the infinite wire and then see how it affects the segments.
>>
>>**Bottom Segment**:
>>By the RHR, the magnetic field generated will point out of the page. Now recall (See Remark $1$) that: $$B_B =\frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi s}$$Now we use the [[Lorentz Force Law]] in terms of current: $$F_B = I \int (dl \times B_B)$$By the RHR, the force produced will point upwards: $$F_B = I \int dl \left( \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi s} \right) = \frac{\mu_0 I^2a}{2 \pi s}  \; \; \text{(up)}$$
>>**Top segment**:
>>Here the segment is at a distance $s+a$ away from the bar. Hence: $$B_T =\frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi (s+a)}$$And points into the page by the RHR. The RHR for the force now tells us that it will also be pointing downwards. Applying the Lorentz Force Law in terms of current gives:  $$F_T = I \int dl \left( \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi (s+a)} \right) = \frac{\mu_0 I^2a}{2 \pi (s+a)}  \; \; \text{(down)}$$**Net Force**:
>>Now we calculate the net force. Since both$F_T \; \land \; F_B$ point upwards, $F_{mag}$ will clearly point upwards as well. Hence: $$F_{mag} = F_T+F_B = -\frac{\mu_0 I^2a}{2 \pi (s+a)} + \frac{\mu_0 I^2a}{2 \pi s} = \frac{\mu_0 I^2 a^2}{2 \pi s (s+a)}\; \; \text{(up)}$$
