>[!definition] Coulomb’s Law
>What is the force on a test charge $Q$ due to a single point charge $q$, that is at rest a distance $\tau$ away? Based on experiments, it is: $$F = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{qQ}{\tau^2}\hat{\tau}$$Where:
>- $\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \frac{\text{C}^2}{\text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2}$ is the permittivity of free space.
>- $\hat{\tau}$ is the direction of the force.

Coulomb’s Law and the [[Principle of Superposition]] form a base for the entirety of electrostatics.
