Recall that $E = -\nabla V$. Thus, by combining this with [[Gauss’s Law]], there should be a way to write $\frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\rho$ in terms of $V$. 

>[!definition|*] Poisson’s Equation
>By substituting the expression for $E$ with $-\nabla V$, we get the following: (It is important to remember that $\nabla \cdot \nabla = \nabla^2$): $$\nabla^2 V = -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$$

In a region with no charge, we get [[Laplace’s Equation]]. Poisson’s Equation allows us to calculate $\rho$ knowing $V$, but we are interested in the opposite.\, specifically the [[Potential of a Localized Charge Distribution]].

This equation is important as it, along with [[Laplace’s Equation]], allows us to verify if the [[Electric Potential]] we found is correct.
