>[!def|*] Uniqueness Theorems
>- The solution to [[Laplaceâ€™s Equation]] in some volume $\mathcal V$ is uniquely determined if $V$ is specified on the boundary surface $\mathcal S$.
>- In a volume $\mathcal V$ surrounded by [[Conductors]] and containing a specified charge density $\rho$, the [[Electric Field]] is uniquely determined if the total charge on each conductor is given.
