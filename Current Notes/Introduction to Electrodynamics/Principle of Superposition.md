The principle of superposition states that the interaction between two charges is completely unaffected by the presence of others.

>[!rmk|*] Superposition
>Suppose we had a system containing $n$ point charges $q$. Then by the principle of superposition, to determine the force on $Q$, we can compute the force exerted by all the charges individually using [[Coulombâ€™s Law]] then sum them all up: $$F = F_1 + F_2 + F_3 + \dots F_n$$

This also works for the electric field.
