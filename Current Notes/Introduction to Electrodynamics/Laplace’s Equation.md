Following from [[Poisson’s Equation]]:
>[!definition|*] Laplace’s Equation
>In an area with no charge, Poisson’s Equation reduces to:$$\nabla^2 V = 0$$In cartesian coordinates, we have: $$\frac{\partial^2 V} {\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial ^2V} {\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial ^2V} {\partial z^2} = 0$$

Laplace’s Equation is so fundamental that one could say electrostatics is the study of Laplace’s equation.

>[!rmk|*] Properties 
>Laplace’s Equation has two defining properties:
>- The value of $V$ at point $r$ is the average value of $V$ over a spherical surface of radius $R$ centered at $r$: $$V(r) = \frac{1}{4\pi R^2} \oint_{\text{sphere}}V\:da$$
>- As a consequence, $V$ has no local maxima or minima. The extreme values of $V$ must occur at the boundaries.
