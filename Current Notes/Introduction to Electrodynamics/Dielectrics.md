We know, to good approximation, that *most* everyday objects belong to one of two large classes, either [[Conductors]] or Insulators (Dielectrics).

>[!def|*] Dielectrics/Insulators
>In dielectrics, all charges are attached to specific atoms or molecules. Outside charges can affect the molecules inside the insulator by stretching and rotating them.

We continue with our discussion in [[Induced Dipoles]].
