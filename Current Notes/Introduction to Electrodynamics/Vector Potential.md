Consider this to be the magnetostatics equivalent to [[Electric Potential]]. 

>[!def|*] Vector Potential $A$
>The vector potential $A$ is given by: $$B = \nabla \times A$$A property of $A$ is: $$\nabla \cdot A = 0$$

We also have the following parallels:

>[!rmk|*] Other Properties
>We have: $$\nabla^2 A = -\mu_0 J$$And: $$A(r) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \int \frac{J(r')}{\tau} \: dv$$

>[!rmk|*] Line and Surface currents:
>We have, for a line current: $$A = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \int \frac{I}{\tau} \:dl$$And for a surface element: $$A = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \int \frac{K}{\tau} \:da$$

Since a magnetic field does no work, it is impossible to give $A$ a physical meaning (although it *can* be interpreted as momentum per unit charge).
