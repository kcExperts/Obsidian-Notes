>[!definition] Cylindrical Coordinates
>Cylindrical coordinates can be described as: $$ x= s cos(\phi), \; y = s sin(\phi), \; z = z$$ Where $s$ is the distance between the origin and the point in question and $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle (counter-clockwise around the $xy$ plane).

If we consider infinitesimal changes in cylindrical coordinates, it would be better to represent it in vector form:
>[!definition] Infinitesimal Changes in Spherical Coordinates
>If we consider a small change in $dl$ where $dl$ is a change in length, we get: $$dl_s = ds\;\hat{s}, \; dl_{\phi} = rd\phi \;\hat{\phi}, \; dl_z =dz \;\hat{z}$$
