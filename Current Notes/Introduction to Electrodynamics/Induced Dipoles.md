>[!rmk|*]- Motivation
>Suppose I put a neutral atom in an [[Electric Field]] $E$. Now I ask, what happens? You might guess nothing since the atom is neutral and thus no charge is present. But that is incorrect. 
>The atom has a positively charges core and a negatively charged electron cloud surrounding it. These two regions will be influenced by the field. The electrons are pushed away from the field and the protons (nucleus) is pulled towards it. 
>If the field $E$ is strong enough, it can pull the atom apart, “ionizing” it (the substances then becomes [[Conductors]]). With less extreme fields, a balance is found. 

>[!def|*] Polarized
>An atom is polarized when it reaches an equilibrium between the outside [[Electric Field]] $E$ and the internal field attracting the protons and electrons together. 

A distance between the positive and negative charges will exist in a polarized atom, hence it will have a [[Monopole and Dipole Moment|Dipole Moment]] $p$, which points in the **same direction** as $E$. Typically, the induced $p$ will be proportional to $E$.

>[!def|*] Atomic Polarizability
>A polarized atom will have a dipole moment $p$ pointing in the same direction as $E$. It is usually proportional to $E$: $$p = \alpha E$$Where $\alpha$ is called the atomic polarizability. It depends on the structure of the atom in question.

>[!exm|1]
>A primitive model for an atom consist of a point nucleus ($+1)$ surrounded by a uniformly charged spherical cloud $(-1)$ of radius $a$. Calculate the atomic polarizability of such an atom.
>>[!claim|*]- Solution
>>Clearly we must solve for $\alpha$ in: $$p = \alpha E$$Thus we need to find $p$ and $E$. Let us start with $E$. Suppose that equilibrium is reached when the nucleus is displaced a distance $d$ from the center (origin). Then the electric field $E_e =E$ at a distance $d$ where $E_e$ is the electric field induced by the positive and negative charges. Now since the nucleus shifted from the origin, the electric field $E_e$ lies from the origin to $d$. Now, in Example 4 in [[Gauss’s Law]], we calculated that the electric field inside the sphere in relation to the total charge would be: $$E_{in} = \frac{Q_t}{4 \pi R^3 \epsilon_0} r \; \hat r$$Replacing with the required quantities and ignoring the vectors nets: $$E_e = \frac{qd}{4 \pi a^3 \epsilon_0}$$At equilibrium: $$E_e = E = \frac{qd}{4 \pi a^3 \epsilon_0}$$Hence: $$p = qd = 4\pi a^3 \epsilon_0 E$$Since $p = \alpha E$, we clearly see: $$\alpha = 4 \pi a^3 \epsilon_0 = 3 \epsilon_0 v$$Where $v$ us the volume of the atom.
