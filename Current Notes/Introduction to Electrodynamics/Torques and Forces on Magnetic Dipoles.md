>[!def|*] Torque Force
>The torque generated is given by: $$N = m \times B$$where $m = Iab$ is the [[Magnetic Dipole]] moment of the loop.

Now note that in a uniform field, the net force on a current loop is zero: $$F = I \oint (dl \times B) = I \left( \oint dl \right) \times B = 0$$
>[!def|*] Infinitesimal Loop
>For an infinitesimal loop, with [[Magnetic Dipole]] moment $m$ in an [[Biot-Savart Law|Magnetic Field]] $B$, the force is: $$F = \nabla(m \cdot B)$$

#### Exercises
>[!exercise|1]
>Calculate the torque exerted on the square loop shown on the square loop below due to the circular loop (assume $r >> a \; \land \; b$). If the square loop is free to rotate, what will its equilibrium orientation be?
