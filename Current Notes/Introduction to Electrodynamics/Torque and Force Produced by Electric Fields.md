>[!def|*] Torque in a Polar Molecule
>Any dipole $p = qd$ in a uniform [[Electric Field]] $E$ experiences a torque:$$N = p \times E$$

Notice that $N$ is in such a direction as to line $p$ up parallel to $E$. A polar molecule that is free to rotate will swing around until it points in the direction of the applied field.

However, if a field is nonuniform, so that $F_+$ does not cancel out $F_-$, there will be a net force on the dipole in addition to the torque.

>[!def|*] Force in a Polar Molecule
>The formula for the force on a dipole in a nonuniform field is given by: $$F = F_+ + F_- = q(E_+ - E_-) = q(\Delta E)$$For a very short dipole, we have: $$F = (p \cdot \nabla ) E$$
