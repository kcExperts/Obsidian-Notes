>[!def|*] Permittivity
>Define: $$\epsilon = \epsilon_0 (1 + \mathcal X_e)$$to be permittivity of a material. Where $\mathcal X_e$ is the [[Linear Dielectrics|Electric Susceptibility]]. 

>[!rmk|*] Permittivity of Free Space
>In a vacuum, where there is no matter to polarize, the susceptibility is $0$ and the permittivity is $\epsilon_0$. Hence why $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.
