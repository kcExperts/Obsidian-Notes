We note that the [[Fundamental Theorem of Linear Maps]] will have important consequences on what we will do next. But before that, we need to express questions about system of linear equations in terms of linear maps.

Now suppose we had a system of linear equations. Such a system can be represented by:$$f(x_1,\dots,x_m) = (A_{11}x_1 +\dots+A_{1m}x_mm,\dots,A_{1n}x_1 + \dots+A_{nm}x_n\}$$In the homogeneous case, clearly $0_v$ is a solution. But we would like to know if any other solutions exist. If we think about it, it would be wise to check if the $\text{null}(T) \ne \{0\}$. That would mean that other solutions exist.

>>[!claim|*]- Proof
>>`\begin{proof}` If we rephrase this in the context of linear algebra, we would have a $T\in L(V,W)$ where $\text{dim}(V) > \text{dim}(W)$. By a corollary of the [[Fundamental Theorem of Linear Maps]], we have that $T$ is not injective. Since $T$ is not injective, we have that $\text{null}(T) \ne \{0\}$, thus more solutions exist.

A [[Linear Maps|Linear Map]] $T \in L(V,W)$ has the general form: $$f(x_1,\dots,x_m) = (A_{11}x_1 +\dots+A_{1m}x_mm,\dots,A_{1n}x_1 + \dots+A_{nm}x_n\}$$
We typically denote all $A$â€™s in [[Matrices|Matrix]] form: $$A = \left[\begin{array}{ccc} A_{11} & \dots & A_{1m} \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ A_{n1} & \dots & A_{nm} \end{array}\right]$$
