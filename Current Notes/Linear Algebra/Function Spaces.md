Function spaces are a special type of vector space. Usually, their operations are defined as follows:

>[!definition|*] Operations on function spaces
>- $+: \:(f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)$
>- $\cdot : (\lambda \cdot f)(x)=\lambda f(x) \forall \lambda \in \mathbb{F}$

>[!definition|*] Function Spaces
>- $C(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$ is the set of all continuous real functions.
>- $P_{\le\: n}(\mathbb{R})$ is the set of all real polynomial functions of degree n.
