>[!def|*] Unitary Matrix
>An $n$-by-$n$ matrix is called [[Unitary Operators|Unitary]] if its columns form an [[Orthonormal]] list in $\mathbb{F}^n$.

>[!theorem|1] Characterizations of unitary matrices
>Suppose $Q$ is an $n$-by-$n$ matrix. Then the following are equivalent:
>1. $Q$ is a unitary matrix.
>2. The rows of $Q$ form an orthonormal list in $\mathbb{F}^n$.
>3. $||Qv|| = ||v||$ for every $v \in \mathbb{F}^n$.
>4. $Q^*Q = QQ^* = I$, where $I$ is the [[Identity Matrix]].
