Invertible matrices are of particular interest as they allow so solve systems of linear equations trivially.

>[!def|*] Invertible, Inverse $A^{-1}$
>A square matrix $A$ is called invertible if there is a square matrix $B$ of the same size where $AB = BA = I$. We call $B$ the inverse of $A$ and denote it as $A^{-1}$.
