>A [[Linear Maps|Linear Map]] from a [[Vector Space]] to itself is called an operator.

>[!def|*] Invariant Subspace
>Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$.  [[Vector Subspace|Subspace]] $U$ of $V$ if called invariant under $T$ is $Tu \in U$ for every $u \in U$.

>[!exm|1]- Example of Invariant Subspaces
>- Suppose $T \in \mathcal L (\mathcal P(\mathbb{R}))$ is defined by $Tp = p’$. Then $\mathcal P_4(\mathbb{R})) \subseteq \mathcal L (\mathcal P(\mathbb{R}))$ is invariant under $T$ has if $p \in \mathcal P(\mathbb{R})$ has degree at most $4$, $p’$ (technically) also has degree at most $4$. 
>- $\text{null}(T)$ is invariant as $\forall \: u\in \text{null}(T) \implies Tu =0$.
>- $\text{range}(T)$ is invariant as $\forall \: u \in \text{range}(T) \implies Tu = u$.
