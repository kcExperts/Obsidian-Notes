>[!definition|*] Finite Dimensional
>A [[Vector Space]] is called finite-dimensional if some list of vectors $v_1,\dots,v_m$ [[Span|Spans]] the space of $V$ (Recall that a list of vectors is always finite by definition).

>[!theorem|*] Length of [[Linearly Independent|L.I]] list vs. length of a [[Span|Spanning List]].
In a finite-dimensional vector space, the length of a Linearly Independent list is always $\le$ the length of the spanning list.

>[!lemma] Every [[Vector Subspace|Subspace]] of a finite-dimensional [[Vector Space|V.S]] is finite dimensional
