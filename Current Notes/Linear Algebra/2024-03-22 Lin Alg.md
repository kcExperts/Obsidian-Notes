>1. This question is easy. For a, expand using the definition then add them. For b, start from the right and get the left side. For c, do the same as b. For d, it is easy as $\hat T$ is an isomorphism.
>2. Also easy. Make $\hat S + \hat T$ into $\widehat{S+T}$. Going to have to manipulate indices. For index $ij$, show if $i > j$, then $ij = 0$. 
>3. For a, for $\mathbb{R}$, use the usual method of applying $T$ twice and argue linear independence. Overall also easy allegedly.
>4. Fix a basis and see what happens.
>5. Use U.T.
>6. Covered with things from today.
>7. Covered with things from today.

>For Q1 to Q5, each can be solved in 4 to 5 lines.
