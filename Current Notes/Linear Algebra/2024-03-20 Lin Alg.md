>1. If $\mathcal B$ is a basis for $V$: $T \in \mathcal L (V)$ where $\hat T$ is upper triangular. This does not necessarily mean that any $\hat S$ for any $S \in \mathcal L (V)$ is upper triangular.
>2. If $\hat T$ is upper triangular with respect to a basis $\mathcal B$. Then the eigenvalues are a subset of $\hat T_{jj}$. 
>3. We will see later that the eigenvalues of an upper triangular matrix are given directly by the diagonal. 
>4. Existence? Does there exist a basis for $V$ such that $\hat T$ is upper triangular? The difficulty of solving this is on the same level as solving for the minimal polynomial (as the eigenvalues are given in both cases). Now if $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb C$, then the answer is **yes**.
>5. If $\mathcal B$ is a basis such that $T,S \in \mathcal L (V)$ where $\hat T, \hat S$ are upper triangular, then $[T,S] =  0$?
