>[!definition|*] Span
The set of all [[Linear Combination|Linear Combinations]] of $v_1, \dots, v_n$ in $V$ is called the span of $v_1, \dots, v_n$ denoted as: $$span(v_1, \dots, v_n) \;\;\lor\;\; S_{v_1,\dots,v_n}$$
If the $span(v_1,\dots,v_n)=V \implies v_1,\dots,v_n$ spans $V$.

Similar to [[Direct Sum|Direct Sums]], the span of $V$ is the smallest subspace containing all the vectors in a given list of vectors $v_1,\dots,v_n$.
