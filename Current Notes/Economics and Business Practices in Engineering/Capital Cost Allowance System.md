The examples in [[Effect of Taxation on Cash Flows]] and [[IRR Tax Calculations]] were all based on a [[Straight-Line Depreciation|SLD]]. In Canada, most assets must be depreciated using the [[Declining-Balance Depreciation|DBD]]. The regulations are set out in the capital cost allowance (CCA) system.

When a firm buys an asset, is it almost always subject to depreciation (land is an exception) and companies may deduct the capital expense over a period of years by claiming depreciation expense each year of the assetâ€™s useful life. Usually companies would want to deduct it immediately, but this would lead to less taxes payed. To prevent less taxes from being payed, the government defines a specific amount of depreciation that companies may claim any year for any one depreciable asset.
