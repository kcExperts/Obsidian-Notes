There are always many different opportunities that a company can face. Identifying which type of opportunities these are is always useful. Project may be:

>[!def|*] Independent
>Two projects are independent if the cost and revenue of one does not depend on if the other is chosen or not. For example, the expected cost and benefits of a computer do not depend on whether or not a vacuum cleaner is purchased. 

>[!def|*] Mutually Exclusive
>Two projects are mutually exclusive if when one is chosen, the other **cannot** be chosen.

>[!def|*] Related, but not Mutually Exclusive
>Two projects are related, but not mutually exclusive if the expected costs and benefits of one project depends on whether the other one is chose. For example, if a company wanted to install EV chargers on two different streets, placing one would realistically have an effect on the revenue of the other.

When choosing $n$ projects for the related, but not mutually exclusive approach, there are *generally* $2^n$ possible outcomes (take its power set). Below is a special case of a related project:

>[!def|*] Contingent
>Two related projects are contingent on another if choosing one option allows the other option to be bought. One can imagine a PC with integrated graphics being bought and deciding whether or not to purchase a graphics card.
