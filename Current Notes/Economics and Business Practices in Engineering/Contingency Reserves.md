Contingency reserves are among the most common methods used to mitigate project risk.

>Refers to the specific provision for an unforeseen element of cost within the defined project scope. They are viewed differently depending on the industry. The expected cost of a project with contingency taken into consideration is: $$\text{Expected Cost} = \text{Task estimated Cost} \: \times \: \text{Task Contingency Multiplier}$$

Usually contingency reserves can be seen by stakeholders as a sign of poor planning. The best way to offset this concern is to offer documentation of past risk events - unforeseen or uncontrollable circumstances that required the need for such contingency planning. The concern that might be generated may also be offset if the project team has done its homework and demonstrated in a detailed plan how contingency funds will be released if they are needed.

>Used to offset budget cutbacks, schedule overruns, or other unforeseen circumstances accruing to individual tasks or project work packages. These are valuable as they provide breathing room for management. 

>[!def|*] Managerial Contingency
>Budget safety measures that address higher-level risks that have project-side impacts. So called “acts of God” would have a managerial contingency.
