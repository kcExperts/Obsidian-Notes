What will signal the need to act?
>[!def|*] Risk Mitigation Strategies
>Refers to the steps taken to minimize the potential impact of those risk factors deemed sufficiently threatening to the project. See also: [[Contingency Reserves]]

### Addressing Risk
In a general sense, there are four possible alternatives a project organization can adopt in deciding how to address risks:

>[!def|*] Accept the Risk
>One option that a project team must consider is whether the risk is sufficiently strong that any action is warranted. If the overall risk factor is low, then it may be more economical to do nothing about it.

>[!def|*] Minimize the Risk
>If action is warranted, applying strategies to minimize risks is the next option. An example would be getting in touch with the suppliers directly so that they can have a connection with your quality assurance team.

>[!def|*] Share the Risk
>Risk may be allocated proportionately among multiple members of the project. This can be accomplished through a contract or willingly. For example, building a spaceship requires immense investments that no one company can provide, thus multiple companies band together to build the spaceship and assume responsibility if their part fails.

>[!def|*] Transfer the Risk
>In some cases, when it is impossible to change the nature of the risk through elimination or minimization, it may be possible to shift the risks bound in a project to another party. Thus the company doing the project may not need to assume the responsibility of the risk. For example, to prevent excessive budget overruns, fixed-price contracts may be used. This provides the worker with a fixed amount of money and if they go above it, they must pay out of pocket. Insurance is also a common option.
