This is the third basic component of the integrated approach. There exist three different types, each used at different levels of a project:

>[!def|*] Estimate Types
> - Order-of-magnitude estimates: Used in the planning and initial evaluation stage of a project.
> 	- Range of $\pm30$ to $50\%$
> - Budget estimates: Used in the preliminary or conceptual design stage of a project.
> 	- Range of $\pm 15\%$
> - Definitive estimates: Used in the detailed engineering/construction stage of a project.
> 	- Range of $\pm 5\%$

>[!def|*] Sources for estimating data
>Information for estimating costs are found in:
>- Accounting records: Rarely contain information on [[Cost Terminology|incremental costs or opportunity costs]], which are important for an engineering analysis. Hence these are not suitable for direct use.
>- Sources inside the firm
>- Sources outside the firm
>- Research and development (R&D)
