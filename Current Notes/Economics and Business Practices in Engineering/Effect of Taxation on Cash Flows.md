Note that business expenses are important. Since they are reported on the income statement, they will be deducted from any revenues and since companies are taxed on net profit, it will lead to lower taxable income.

>[!exm|*] Example for the concepts
>A corporation is buying a machine that has the following costs and revenues:
>- First cost of $\$45\:000$;
>- Savings of $\$23\:000$ per year;
>- Operating costs of $\$7300$ per year;
>- Salvage value of $\$5000$ (lifespan of $5$ years).
>
>The corporate tax rate $t$ is $42\%$ and the after-tax MARR is $12\%$.

#### Effect of Taxes on First Cost
Recall that the first cost in the disbursement that a company makes, for example, to buy a brand new machine or to construct a new warehouse. Usually first costs are paid immediately at the start of a project whilst taxes are paid at the end of the year (which we can interpret as $1$ on a cash flow diagram). 

Given a choice, a firm would want to write off (depreciate) an investment as quickly as possible (as the tax savings will accrue faster). However, there are undesirable effects. It may create opportunity for inefficient business decisions and from the governments stand point, it can lead to the firm exploiting tax rules. To counter this, tax authorities have carefully defined the depreciation methods permitted for use in computing taxes. The permitted methods may not reflect that true depreciation expenses (the permitted depreciation charge set by a tax authority is called the **capital cost allowance**). For most purposes, we can consider these to be equivalent.

>[!exm|*] First Costs
>What is the present worth of the machine’s first cost?
>
>The first cost of $\$45\:000$ will lead to benefits in the form of an annuity as every year taxes will be calculated and there will be a tax saving. Since the corporate tax rate is $42\%$ (and it does not decrease over time or anything like that), we give rise to yearly savings (over $5$ years) of: $$45\:000\ \times \frac{0.42}{5} = \$3780$$With this, to calculate the present worth $PW$ of the machine’s first cost, we take the first cost and add the present worth of the tax savings, hence: $$PW = -45\:000 + 3780(P/A, 12\%, 5) \approx -\$31\:400$$

#### Effect of Taxes on Savings (Annuities)
Although the first cost is reduced, this is balanced by the fact that the savings from investments are also reduced. 

>[!exm|*] Savings
>What is the present worth of the after-tax annual net savings created by the machine.
>
>We have $\$23\:000$ in savings per year and $\$7300$ in operating costs per year. Hence there are yearly savings of $\$15\:700$ in savings per year before tax. Thus there are: $$15\:700 \times (1-0.42) = \$9106$$in after-tax savings each year, for $5$ years. Turning this into a present worth amount nets: $$9106 \times (P/A,12\%,5) \approx \$32\:800$$

#### Effect of Taxes on Salvage or Scrap Value
Recall that salvage value is the value at the end of the useful life and scrap value is the value at the end of its physical life. 

>[!exm|*] Scrap Value
>What is the after-tax present worth of the salvage value of the tester?
>
>This is quite easy to do: $$5000 \times (1-0.42) \times (P/F,12\%,5) = \$1646$$

#### Present Worth and Annual Worth
We have so far seen present worth for each value. To get the total present worth, simply add up the savings and the costs.

For the annual worth, get the annual values and add them up.
