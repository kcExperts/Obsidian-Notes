When there are multiple [[Internal Rate of Return|Internal Rates of Return]], we must use the external rate of return. Multiple IRRâ€™s are most easily seen with the concept of **project balance**. 

>[!def|*] External Rate of Return
>The external rate of return (ERR) denoted by $i_e^*$ is the rate of return on a project where any cash flows that are not invested in the project are assumed to earn interest at a predetermined explicit rate (usually the MARR). For a given rate of return, a project can only have one ERR.

>[!claim|*] Approaches
>There are two approaches that we can use:
>1. Precise ERR (need a rate of return which will most likely be a MARR)
>2. Approximate ERR (just need a decision)

These options are best illustrated using examples:

>[!exm|1] Precise ERR
>Consider the following:
>1. Inflow of $\$1000$ at year $0$.
>2. Outflow of $\$5000$ at year $1$.
>3. Inflow of $\$6000$ at year $2$. 
>
>The strategy here is to shift our inflow at year $0$ to year $1$ and then shift the years to the left so that year $1$ becomes year $0$ and so on so forth as then there would only be $1$ sign change. We would transform the inflow from year $0$ to year $1$ using the MARR. From here, we can then apply the IRR method.

>[!exm|2] Approximate ERR
>Consider the following:
>1. Inflow of $\$1000$ at year $0$.
>2. Outflow of $\$5000$ at year $1$.
>3. Inflow of $\$6000$ at year $2$. 
>   
>To do this analysis, move any **cash inflow** to the future (imagine that you immediately invest any earnings into an account at the MARR). Then move every **cash outflow** to where the cash inflow was moved to using the approximate ERR. Then find the IRR.
