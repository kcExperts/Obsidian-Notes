>[!def|*] Current/Actual Interest Rate
>The actual interest rate $i$ is the stated or observed interest rate based on current dollars. 

>[!def|*] Real Interest Rate
>The real interest rate $iâ€™$ is the interest rate that would yield the same number of [[Real and Actual Dollars|Real Dollars]] in the absence of inflation: $$i' = \frac{1+i}{1+f}-1$$Where we recall that $f$ is the inflation rate.

The same formula holds if $i' = \text{MARR}_{\text{R}}$ and $i = \text{MARR}_{\text{A}}$ and similarly for the [[Internal Rate of Return|IRR]].
