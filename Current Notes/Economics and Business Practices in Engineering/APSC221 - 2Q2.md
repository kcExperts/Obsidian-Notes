>As mentioned in class, the CTF and CSF are needed for a complete tax analysis. To do so, we need to find the depreciation value $d$ given by the declining-balance depreciation. This is given by: $$d= 1 - \sqrt[n]{\frac{S}{P}} = 1-\sqrt[12]{\frac{30\:000}{230\:000}}\approx0.1561$$Note that $d= 0.1561$ will be used for the rest of the question. Now with this, we can find the CTF and CSF knowing that $i =0.08 \; \land \; t = 0.45$: $$\text{CTF} = 1 - \frac{td(1+\frac{i}{2})}{(i+d)(1+i)} = 1- \frac{(0.45)(0.1561)(1+\frac{0.08}{2})}{(0.08+0.1561)(1+0.08)} \approx0.7135$$$$\text{CSF} = 1 - \frac{td}{(i+d)} = 1-\frac{(0.45)(0.1561)}{(0.08+0.1561)} \approx 0.7025$$As usual, the rounded values will be used. With these values, we can complete our tax calculations:

>**First Cost**: We have: $$PW_{FC} = -230\:000(0.7135)=-\$164\:105.00$$**Annual Savings**: We have: $$PW_{AS} = [35\:000(1-0.45)] \cdot(P/A,8\%,12) = \$145\:069.93$$**Salvage Value**: We have: $$PW_{SV} = [30\:000 (0.7025)]\cdot(P/F,8\%,12) = \$8368.88$$
>We now get the overall $PW$: $$PW = PW_{FC} + PW_{NS} + PW_{SV} = -\$164\:105.00+\$145\:069.93+\$8368.88 = -10\:666.19$$We see that the after-tax present worth of the project is $-\$1666.19$. Thus Rideau should **not** buy the hoist.
