>Firstly, notice that we have an infinite annuity. We cannot use the standard $P = A/i$ formula to get the value of the infinite annuity as we would be moving back in time, which is not allowed. We need to handle this at the end.

>We now need to transform this into a standard cash flow diagram. To do so, we apply the following procedure: 
>- “*Move cash flows forward in time starting with Year 0, moving to 1, and if that does not produce a standard cash flow, continue moving forward year by year until you achieve a standard cash flow.*”

>**Year 0 to year 1**: $$\text{Net Value at Year 1}=10\:000\:000(F/P,10\%,1)-8\:000\:000 = \$3\:000\:000$$**Year 1 to year 2**:  $$\text{Net Value at Year 2} = 3\:000\:000(F/P,10\%,1) - 8\:000\:000 = -\$4\:700\:000$$**Year 2 to year 3**: $$\text{Net Value at Year 3}= -4\:700\:000(F/P,10\%,1) + 7\:000\:000= \$1\:830\:000$$**Year 3 to year 4**:$$\text{Net Value at Year 4}= 1\:830\:000(F/P,10\%,1) -5\:000\:000 = -\$2\:987\:000$$One might think we end here, after all, a standard cash flow has been reached. However, we continue to year $5$ as it will still net a negative cash flow (leading to an overall standard cash flow)
>
>**Year 4 to year 5**: $$\text{Net Value at Year 5}= -2\:987\:000(F/P,10\%,1)-5\:000\:000 = -\$8\:285\:700$$With this, we have a standard cash flow. From here, to get the precise (exact) ERR, we need only follow the IRR process now. To handle the infinite annuity, we apply the formula but use $i^*$ instead and find its value. $$0= -8\:286\:700  +\frac{1\:000\:000}{i^*} \implies i^* = \frac{1\:000\:000}{8\:286\:700} \approx 0.1207  = 12.07\%$$The project has an ERR of $12.07\%$. Since this percentage is greater than the MARR, Eclipse Corp should proceed with the project.

>Alternatively, you could have stopped at year $4$ and the answer would be *about* the same: $$0=-2\:987\:000-5\:000\:000(P/F,i^*,1)+\frac{1\:000\:000}{i^*}(P/F,i^*,1) \implies i^* \approx 0.1198 = 11.98\%$$There will be a rounding error so doing the original method of putting to year $5$ is superior.
