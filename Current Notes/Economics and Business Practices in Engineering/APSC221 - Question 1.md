>[!claim|*] Solution for part A
>As the manufacturing company sells $1250000$ blind rivets each year at a prince of $\$650$ for a pack of $500$, we have that the estimated annual revenue for the blind rivets $R_b$ is given by: $$R_b = 1\:250\:000 \cdot \frac{650}{500} = \$1\:625\:000$$
>Hence the estimated annual revenue for the blind rivets is $\$1\:625\:000$.

>[!claim|*] Solution for part B
>Recall that the operating cost for the lathe and the drill are $\$18.60$ per hour and $\$16.90$ per hour respectively. I am assuming that $1\:250\:000$ units are sold in a year.
>
>**Design A**:
>This design requires $10$ hours of lathe and $5$ hours of drill for $1\:000$ units. The total time to produce the required units on the lathe is $(10 \cdot 1\:250) = 12\:500$ hours. Thus the total cost to use the lathe is $(12\:500 \cdot 18.60) = \$232\:500$. The total time needed on the drill is $(5\cdot 1\:250) = 6\:250$ hours. Thus the total cost to use the drill is $(6\:250 \cdot 16.90)= \$105\:625$. In total, design A has a cost of $\:\$338\:125$.
>
>**Design B**:
>This design requires $7$ hours of lathe and $10$ hours of drill for $1\:000$ units. The total time to produce the required units on the lathe is $(7 \cdot 1\:250) = 8\:750$ hours. Thus the total cost to use the lathe is $(8\:750 \cdot 18.60) = \$162\:750$. The total time needed on the drill is $(10\cdot 1\:250) = 12\:500$ hours. Thus the total cost to use the drill is $(12\:500 \cdot 16.90)= \$211\:250$. In total, design B has a cost of $\:\$374\:000$.

>[!claim|*] Solution for part C
>From part B, we clearly see that design A has a lower overall cost then design B. Furthermore, since the material costs are identical for both designs, design A is the superior choice and will offer the company better profits (**NOTE: THERE ARE MISSING PROFIT CALCULATIONS WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY REVENUE - COST**)
>
>With a material cost of $\$20\:000$ per $100\:000$ rivets, it will cost $\$250\:000$ for $1\:250\:000$ rivets. The total savings design A offers over design B is $((374\:000 + 250\:000)-(338\:125 + 250\:000)) = \$35\:875$.
