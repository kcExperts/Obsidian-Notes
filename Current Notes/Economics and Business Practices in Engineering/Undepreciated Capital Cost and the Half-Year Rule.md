The basis for calculating the capital cost allowance for assets is the total undepreciated capital cost (UCC) of the assets included in that class.

>[!def|*] UCC
>Whereas the capital cost of an asset is the total cost of acquiring the asset, the UCC is the remaining book value for the assets subject to depreciation for taxation purposes, which may or may not differ from the market or salvage value. 

>[!def|*] Half-Year Rule
>Only half of the capital cost of acquiring an asset can be claimed in the UCC for the first year. The remaining amount is left in the UCC for next year.
>
>This was created to prevent corporations from purchasing assets at the end of a year, just to sell immediately in the new year.

>[!exm|*] UCC
>Suppose a company bought a $\$1\:000\:000$ machine. The [[Capital Cost Allowance System|CCA]] rate is $20\%$ and the company's tax rate is $50\%$.
>In the first year, the full $\$1\:000\:000$ can be added to the UCC account, but only $\$500\:000$ can be subject to a CCA claim (half-year rule). In the first year, it is $20\%$ and overall, a balance of $\$900\:000$ of UCC is left. The next year, we use the current amount left in the UCC and continue.

For any given year (**NO HALF YEAR RULE**?), the UCC balance can be calculated using: $$\text{UCC}_{\text{opening}} + \text{additions} - \text{disposals} - \text{CCA} = \text{UCC}_{\text{ending}}$$
Note: 
- additions $=$ purchases
- disposals $=$ dispositions

Selling an asset is considered disposal. It can also be considered as a negative purchase value.
