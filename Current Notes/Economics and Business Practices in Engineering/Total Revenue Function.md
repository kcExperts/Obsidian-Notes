Here we focus less on the function itself and more on the graph of the function. To do so, we denote some variables:
- $TR$ - Total Revenue
- $C_T$ - Total Cost
- $C_F$ - Fixed Cost
- $C_V$ - Variable Cost
- $D$ - Demand
- $D^*$ - Demand that produces maximum profits
- $Dâ€™_i$ - Where $i \in \mathbb{N}$ represents the $n$ breakeven points.
With this, consider the following diagram:

Here we see that profit is the region above the total cost $C_T$ and below the total revenue $TR$. From this, it is clear that the profit $P$ is given by: $P = TR - C_T$. If $P$ is negative, then a loss is incurred. The breakeven points represent the point where all costs are covered but no profit is made.
