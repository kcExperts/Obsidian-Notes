To assess whether financial objectives are being met, firms rely on the following:
- **Financial Statement**: A written report that *quantitatively* describes a firm’s financial health. The income statement, balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows are the financial statements most frequently used.
- **Forecasts**: Estimates of a firm’s future sales, income, expenses, and capital expenditures, based on its past performance, its current circumstances, and its future plans. New ventures base their forecasts on an estimate of sales and then on industry averages or the experiences of similar start-ups regarding the cost of goods sold and other expenses.
- **Budgets**: Itemized forecasts of a company’s income, expenses, and capital needs and are also an important tool for financial planning and control.

The actual process can be described as follows:
1. Tracking the company’s past financial performance through preparation and analysis of financial statements. These tell a firm how much money it is making or losing (income statement), the structure of its assets and liabilities (balance sheet), and where its cash is coming and going (statement of cash flows). *Most firms look at two to three years of past financial statements when preparing a forecast.*
2. Prepare forecasts for two to three years in the future.
3. Prepare a firm’s pro forma financial statements, which along with its more fine-tuned budgets, constitutes its financial plan.
4. Ongoing analysis of a firm’s financial results. **Financial ratios**, which depict relationships between items on a firm’s financial statements, are used to discern whether a firm is meeting its financial objectives and how it stacks up against its industry peers. These ratios are also used to assess trends.
