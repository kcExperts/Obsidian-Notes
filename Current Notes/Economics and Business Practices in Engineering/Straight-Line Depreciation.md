>[!def|*] Straight-Line Depreciation
>Straight-line depreciation (SLD) assumes that the rate loss of an asset is constant over its useful life. Algebraically, the assumption is that the rate loss depends on its purchase price $P$ and on its salvage value $S$. The depreciation per period from the assetâ€™s current value and its estimated salvage value at the end of its useful life, $N$ periods from now is given by: $$D_{sl} (n) = \frac{P-S}{N}$$

The book value at the end of any particular period is also trivial to find: $$BV_{sl}(n) = P - n \left[ \frac{P-S}{N} \right]$$
Note that $P$ can also be the current market value.
