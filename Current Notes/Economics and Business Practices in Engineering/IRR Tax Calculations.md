The effect of taxation is to modify the pre-tax cash flows. The after-tax [[Internal Rate of Return|IRR]] is simply the IRR calculated on the after-tax cash flows. 

Recall our example from [[Effect of Taxation on Cash Flows]]:

>[!exm|*]- Example for the concepts
>A corporation is buying a machine that has the following costs and revenues:
>- First cost of $\$45\:000$;
>- Savings of $\$23\:000$ per year;
>- Operating costs of $\$7300$ per year;
>- Salvage value of $\$5000$ (lifespan of $5$ years).
>
>The corporate tax rate $t$ is $42\%$ and the after-tax MARR is $12\%$.

>[!exm|*]  IRR Tax Calculation
>What is the accurate after-tax IRR of the machine investment decision?
>
>Here we will translate everything to $PW$ and then find the $i^*$ that yields $0$ (in a sense, repeat the calculations done in [[Effect of Taxation on Cash Flows]] but replace the MARR that we used with the unknown $i^*$): $$45\:000 = (45\:000/5) \cdot 0.42 \cdot (P/A,i^*,5)+15\:700 \cdot (1-0.42) \cdot (P/A,i^*,5)+5000(1-0.42)(P/F,i^*,5)$$Solving nets $i^* = 14.7\%$.

>Alternatively, the $AW$ method can be used as well. In both cases, it passes the MARR and is therefore an acceptable investment.

The relationship between the before and after-tax IRR is identical to the one between the [[Before and After Tax MARR]]: $$\text{IRR}_{\text{after-tax}} \approx \text{IRR}_{\text{before-tax}} \times (1-t)$$where $t$ is the corporate tax rate.
