>[!def|*] Nominal Interest Rate
>The nominal interest rate is the conventional method of stating the annual interest rate. If we wanted to find the rate of a subperiod $i_s$, we use: $$i_s = \frac{r}{m}$$
>Where $r$ is the nominal rate and $m$ are equal subperiods. So a nominal rate of $18\%$ per year compounded monthly is the same as $1.5\%$ per month as: $$1.5\% = 0.015 = \frac{0.18}{12}$$

>[!def|*] Effective Interest Rate
>The effective interest rate is the actual (but not usually stated) interest rate, found by converting a given interest rate with an arbitrary compounding period to an equivalent interest year with a one-year compounding period. Denoted as $i_e$. We can find $i_e$ using: $$i_e = (1+i_s)^m - 1 = \left(  1+\frac{r}{m} \right)  ^m-1$$
