Most people are familiar with personal income tax. Usually the employer provides a report containing the relevant information and then the individual must submit it to the government for processing. Corporate taxes differ from personal income taxes as shown in the definitions below:

>[!def|*] Flat Tax Rate
>A main difference between personal and corporate tax income is that corporate taxes employ a flat tax (as opposed to a progressive tax rate for personal income). A flat tax means that corporations pay the same tax rate, regardless of their income level (these rates do change over time country to country). 

Do note that some countries do give favorable tax treatments to small companies to encourage new businesses. But once they get big enough, they fall into the flat tax rate.

>[!def|*] Calculating Taxes
>Net income for tax purposes is calculated by subtracting expenses from gross income. Thus a company that makes no profit may pay no income tax.
