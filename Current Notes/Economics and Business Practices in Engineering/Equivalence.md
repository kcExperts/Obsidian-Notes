As decisions are made on cost/benefits occurring at different times, we need to be able to assume that values are equivalent. We distinguish three kinds of equivalency:

>[!def|*] Mathematical Equivalency
>The calculations done in this course to equate present and future values all fall under mathematical equivalency. 

To use mathematical equivalency, the two following equivalencies must be true.

>[!def|*] Decisional Equivalency
>A decision maker is indifferent between money now or in the future. So that age old question of a dollar today or a dollar tomorrow should not matter to the decision maker. 

>[!def|*] Market Equivalency
>A decision maker can exchange cash lows at zero cost (by ignoring administrative costs). So when this is true, swipping your credit cards $10$ times for $\$1$ versus $1$ time for $\$10$ dollars is identical (which is not true in reality).
