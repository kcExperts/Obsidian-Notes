Historical financial statements reflect past performance and are usually prepared on a quarterly and annual basis. They are required to be done (unlike the Pro Forma Financial Statements). Historical financial statements include the income statement, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows. They are prepared in this order as they flow logically from one to the next.
