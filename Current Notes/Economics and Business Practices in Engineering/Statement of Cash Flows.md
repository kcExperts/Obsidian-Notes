>[!def|*] Statement of Cash Flows
>This document summarizes the changes in a firm’s cash position for a specified period of time and details why the change occurred. It is similar to a month-end bank statement. It is divided into the following:
>- **Operating Activities**: Include net income (or loss), depreciation, and changes in current assets and current liabilities other than cash and short-term debt. A firm’s net income, taken from its income statement, is the first line on the corresponding period’s cash flow statement. 
>- **Investing Activities**: Include the purchase, sale, or investment in fixed assets, such as real estate, equipment, and buildings.
>- **Financing Activities**: Include cash raised during the period by borrowing money or selling stock and/or cash used during the period by paying dividends, buying back outstanding stock, or buying back outstanding bonds. 

Interpreting and analyzing cash flow statements take practice: 
- *Uses* of cash are recorded as negative figures, **shown using parentheses**.
- *Sources* of cash are recorded as positive figures.
- Depreciation would be shown as a positive figure because it was deducted from nete income on the income statement but was not a cash expenditure. 
- A decrease in accounts payable shows up as a negative figure on the cash flow statement because the firm uses part of its cash to reduce its accounts payable balance from one period to the next.
- *A large increase in a firm’s cash balance is not always a good sign*. It could mean that the firm is borrowing heavily, is not paying down its short-term liabilities, or is accumulating cash that could be put to work for a more productive purpose. On the other hand, it is almost **always prudent** for a **young** firm to have a healthy cash balance.

>2. Is the firm generating enough cash to fund its investment activities from earnings, or is it relying on lenders or investors?
