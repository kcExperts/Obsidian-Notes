>[!def|*] Compound Interest Factors
>Compound interest factors are formulas that define [[Equivalence|Mathematical Equivalence]] for specific common cash flow patterns. This factor makes analysis easier, as spreadsheet functions or tables can be used instead of complex formulas.

We will analyze the following four patterns:
- [[Single Disbursement]]
- [[Annuity]]
- [[Arithmetic Gradient Series]]
- [[Geometric Gradient Series]]

To do this, several assumptions must be done:

>[!claim|*] Assumptions
>1. Compounding periods are of **equal** length.
>2. Each disbursement and receipt occurs at the **end** of a period. A payment at time $0$ can be considered to occur at the end of period $-1$.
>3. Annuities and gradients coincide with the ends of sequential periods.
