Cost and expense can be used interchangeably.

>[!def|1] Fixed Costs
>A fixed cost is an expense that, over a feasible range of operations, remains the same even if it is scaled up or down. They can still be subject to change, but significant events need to occur for this to take place. 

>[!def|2] Variable Cost
>A variable cost is an expense that scales with the range of operations. This cost is evident with small increases in operations.

>[!def|3] Incremental Cost
>An incremental cost is the total expense incurred due to an additional unit of product being produced. These are usually difficult to determine in practice.

Definitions 4,5 and 6 all fall in the overlap between fixed and variable cost.

>[!def|4] Direct Cost
>Direct costs are expenses that can be linked to the creation of a product or service. Materials to create the product are a direct cost.

>[!def|5] Indirect Cost/Overhead
>Indirect costs are expenses that cannot (or are difficult) to allocate to a specific output or work activity. **They are expenses not linked to the creation of a product or service**. General tools, utilities and insurance are some examples. 

>[!def|6] Standard Cost
>Standard costs are predicted expenses per unit of output that is calculated in advanced before production begins. It serves as a benchmark for expected performance and is useful for management.

>[!def|7] Cash Cost
>A cost that involves a payment in cash is a cash cost. A cash cost always results in cash flow (which is the flow of cash in and out of the business).

>[!def|8] Book Cost/Noncash Cost
>A book cost is an expense that does not involve cash payments. It can be the initial amount paid for an investment. Depreciation charged for the use of an asset is a book cost (if we use a machine, it will decrease in value. That decrease is a book cost).

>[!def|9] Sunk Cost
>A sunk cost is an expense that has occurred in the past and that has no relevance in estimates of future costs and revenues. They are irretrievable consequences of past decisions and do not play a role when considering an alternative. A down payment is a sunk cost. 
>
>A simpler example would be if you were deciding what to do with a $\$500$ machine that you had already bought and is not worth $\$200$. That $\$500$ is a sunk cost and will have no direct involvement in the decision to keep or sell the machine. 

>[!def|10] Opportunity Cost
>An opportunity cost is incurred when the use of limited resources is considered. A simple example is deciding whether to work during the summer and gain income, or pay to go to summer school.
