>[!def|*] Opportunity
>An opportunity is a favorable set of circumstances that creates a need for a new product, service, or business.

>[!def|*] Idea
>An idea is a thought, an impression, or a notion. An idea may or may not meet the criteria of an opportunity. This is important as many ventures fail not because of a lack of hard work, but rather because there was no real opportunity to begin with.

Entrepreneurial ventures are started by either external stimulation (such as a large firm deciding it needs to branch out and develop new things) or are internally stimulated (such as a person realizing a need for a product and then creating it). Thus, in a sense, the entrepreneur recognizes a problem that needs to be solved, called an **opportunity gap**. 

Many people fall into the trap of trying to build a business out of a product that exists already, making only minor improvements and hoping to win the market - they will not succeed. 

### Essential Qualities of an Opportunity
An opportunity has four essential qualities. It is: 
1. Attractive;
2. Timely;
3. Durable;
4. Anchored in a product, service, or business that creates or adds value for its buyer or end-user.

>[!def|*] Window of Opportunity
>For an entrepreneur to capitalize on an opportunity, it's window of opportunity must be open. This term is a *metaphor* describing the time period in which a firm can realistically enter a new market. Once the market for a new product is established, the window opens. At some point, the market matures and the window closes.
