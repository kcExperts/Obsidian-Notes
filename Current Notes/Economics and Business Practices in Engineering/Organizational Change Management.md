>[!def|*] Project Change Management
>Since a project is a dynamic process, it is unrealistic to assume that request for change in long-term projects will not occur. Project change management is the process to manage/accommodate change during the project lifecycle.

>[!def|*] Organizational Change Mangement
>The method by which change is carried out throughout an organization to transition from a current state to a desired future state. 

### Essentials of Change Management
Change is risky, and a risky thing needs to be assessed and managed. Essentially, change management is: 
- Understanding the changes and associated implementation risk;
- Implementing the desired change;
- Ensuring transition from current to future state;
- Minimizing unplanned operational disruptions;
- Achieving the desired performance improvements;
- Sustaining change over the long term.

### Human Dimension
Change is made by people, not new systems, processes or tools. The change itself may required new systems, but it is the people’s adoption of these that is the change. It should be obvious that the human response to change is resistance, responses will vary from person to person. It also depends on the person’s interpretation and perceived relationship to the change. 

Change may be experienced at the individual level but it is at the organizational level that it achieves results. Organizations are complex entities and change in one area may have farther reaching impacts than anticipated. After all, they have interdependencies and interrelationships that are not always clearly evident or understood.

### Four Change Outcomes
When applying change, there are four general outcomes. 

>[!def|*] The Disaster
>In this scenario, after the implementation of the change, the performance decreases over time. This can happen as the change is not compatible with the wider business operations. The result of this is the devastating reduction in performance leading to potential bankruptcy or failure.

For the following outcomes, there will be a dip in performance at the beginning either followed by a temporary increase or an increase that stays. 

>[!def|*] The Lost Investment
>In this scenario, the change is implemented and performance may see a temporary increase, however, people revert back to the “old way” of doing things” and the change is not sustained and is abandoned. This abandonment is *very* gradual and is sometimes not even noticed as it happens bit-by-bit.

>[!def|*] The Partial Success
>The change is implemented and there is a sustained improvement in performance. However, the business case is never fully achieved and the organization does not realize the *full* potential of the change. While an overall positive improvement is realized, it could have been much more.

>[!def|*] The Ideal
>Of course, all change results in some decrease in performance but in the ideal, it is shallow and short. The change is implemented and sustained over time with minimal impact in terms of short-term performance impacts. In reality, achieving the optimal result is rare (although possible).
