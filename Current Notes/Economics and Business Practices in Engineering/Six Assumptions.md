To do these comparison methods, six assumptions will need to be made:

1. Costs and benefits are measurable in terms of money.
2. Future cash flows are known with certainty.
3. Cash flows are unaffected by inflation or deflation (for now).
4. Unless otherwise stated, there are sufficient funds to implement all projects.
5. Taxes are not applicable.
6. All investments have a cash outflow (cost) at the start. It is called the **First Cost**.
