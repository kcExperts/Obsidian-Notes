When a decision is made to acquire a new asset, it is essentially the decision to purchase the capacity to perform tasks or produce output. 

>[!rmk|*] Capacity
>Capacity is the ability to produce, measured in units of production per time period.

>[!def|*] Capital Cost
>The capital cost of an asset is the expense incurred over time because the asset required for that capacity gradually losses its value. It is the difference between what is paid for the asset and what it could be resold for some time after purchase. The largest portion of capital costs typically occurs early in the life of the asset.

>[!def|*] Installation Costs
>Installation costs are the costs of acquiring capacity that is not the initial purchase cost (training new workers, expanding the facility or reorganization are all examples).

Usually, the first cost $P$ of an asset usually includes installation costs. However, to compute the salvage value over the ages, we do not include installation costs. 

>[!def|*] Operating and Maintenance Costs
>These are future costs incurred by an asset so that it can keep running. Operating costs include electricity, gasoline and others whilst maintenance involves the servicing and repair costs.
