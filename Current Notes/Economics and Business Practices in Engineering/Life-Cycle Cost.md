>[!def|*] Life-Cycle Cost
>A life-cycle cost are all the expenses related to a product, structure, system, or service during the entirety of its life-span. Such a cost begins with the identification of the economic need or want and ends with the retirement and disposal of activities.

Life-cycle costs are broken into two categories. The first one being the acquisition phase which involves all costs before the product is made (development and design). The second category is the operation phase which consists of all costs relating to the upkeep or production of the product all the way to the cost to retire or shut down the operation.

One can notice that cost saving should be done in the acquisition phase as that is when expenses add up. After that, they are “locked in”.
