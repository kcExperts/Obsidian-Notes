This is an assessment of the overall appeal of the product or service being proposed. Although there are many things to consider when launching a new venture, nothing else matters if the product or service itself doesn’t sell. 

>[!def|*] Feasibility
>An assessment of the overall appeal of the product or service being proposed. 

>[!def|*] Desirability
>Do the following:
>1. **Ask yourself**: Does it make sense? Is it reasonable? Is it something consumers will get excited about? Is this a good time to introduce the product or service to the marketplace? Does it take advantage of a trend, solve a problem or take advantage of a gap in the marketplace?
>2. **Concept test**: A concept statement should be developed. It is a one-page description of a business that is distributed to people who are asked to provide feedback on the potential of the business idea. Concisely describe the: Product or service opportunity, Intended target market, Benefits of the product or service, Positioning relative to competitors, Management team. The feedback will hopefully provide a sense of viability and suggestions on how the idea can be strengthened before proceeding further.

>[!def|*] Demand
>Here we talk face-to-face with potential customers as the only way to know what the people want is to ask them directly. The idea is to gauge customer reaction to the general concept of what you want to sell, and tweak, revise, and improve on the idea based on the feedback. In some cases, talking with potential customers will cause you to abandon an idea (often, ideas we think are good will get lukewarm reactions).
>
>Utilize online tools to gauge reactions from potential customers. Purchasing text ads is a great way to get some feedback. As an example, demand can be measured based on how many people click the link of the ad.

>[!def|*] Target Market
>Here we do an assessment of the overall appeal of the industry and the target market for the proposed business. An industry is a group of firms producing a similar product or service. A firm’s target market is the limited portion of the industry it plans to go after.

>[!def|*] Industry Attractiveness
>Industries vary in terms of their overall attractiveness. Of particular importance is the degree to which environmental and business trends are moving in favor rather than against the industry.

>[!def|*] Characteristics of Attractive Industries
>- Young rather than old;
>- Early rather than late in their life cycle;
>- Fragmented rather than concentrated;
>- Growing rather than shrinking;
>- Selling products and services that customers “must have” rather than “want to have”;
>- Not a crowded marketplace;
>- Not highly dependent on a historically low price of key raw materials;
>- Have high rather than low operating margins.

>[!def|*] Target Market Attractiveness
>The challenge in identifying an attractive target market is to find a market that’s large enough for the proposed business but is yet small enough to avoid attracting larger competitors. Assessing the attractiveness of a target market is tougher than assessing the attractiveness of an entire industry. Often, considerable ingenuity must be employed to find information to assess the attractiveness of a specific target market.

>[!def|*] Organizational Feasibility
>Conducted to determine whether a proposed business has sufficient:
>- Management expertise;
>- Organizational competence;
>- Resources to successfully launch a business.
>
>This part focuses on non-financial resources.

>[!def|*] Management Prowess
>A proposed business should candidly evaluated the prowess, or ability, of its management team to satisfy itself that management has the requisite passion and expertise to launch the venture. Two of the most important factors in this area are:
>1. The passion that the individual or founding team has for the business idea.
>2. The extend to which the individual or the founding team understands the markets in which the firm will participate.

>[!def|*] Resource Sufficiency
>This topic pertains to an assessment of whether there are sufficient resources to launch the proposed venture. To test resource sufficiency, a firm should list the $6$ to $12$ most critical nonfinancial resources that will be needed to move the business idea forward successfully. If critical resources are not available in certain areas, it may be impractical to proceed with the business idea.

The above two blocks describe what is needed for an **Organizational Feasibility Analysis**.

>[!def|*] Financial Feasibility
>The final part of a feasibility analysis involves a preliminary financial assessment. 
>
>**Total Start-Up Cash Needed**
>The first issue refers to the total cash needed to prepare the business to make its first sale. An actual budget should be prepared that lists all the anticipated capital purchases and operating expenses needed to generate the first $\$1$ in revenues. The point of this exercise is to determine if the proposed venture is realistic given the total start-up cash needed. 
>
>**Financial Performance of Similar Businesses**
>Estimate the proposed start-up’s financial performance by comparing it to similar, already established businesses. There are several ways of doing this, which involve a little ethical detective work:
>- There are many reports available, some for free and some that require a fee. These offer detailed industry trend analysis and reports on thousands of individual firms.
>- Simple observational research may be needed. 
>
>**Overall Financial Attractiveness of the Proposed Venture**
>A number of other financial factors are associated with promising business start-up’s. In the feasibility analysis stage, the extend to which a business opportunity is positive relative to each factor is based on an estimate rather than actual performance.

>[!def|*] Financial Factors associated with Promising Business Opportunities
>- Steady and rapid growth in sales during the first $5$ to $7$ years in a clearly defined market niche.
>- High percentage of recurring revenue (meaning that once a firm wins a client, the client will provide recurring sources of revenue).
>- Ability to forecast income and expenses with a reasonable degree of certainty.
>- Internally generated funds to finance and sustain growth.
>- Availability of an exit opportunity for investors to convert equity to cash.

>[!def|*] First Screen
>This part is shown the chapter appendix. It is a template for completing a feasibility analysis. It is called a first screen because it is a tool that can be used in the initial pass at determining the feasibility of a business idea. If a business idea cuts muster at this stage, the next step is to complete a business plan. The link to the appendix is as follows: [[APSC-221_W22-S23.pdf#page=522&selection=4,0,11,1|APSC-221_W22-S23, page 522| First Screen]]
