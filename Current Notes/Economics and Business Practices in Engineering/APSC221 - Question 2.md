>I will keep my work to $4$ decimal places (without rounding) and round off to $2$ decimal places for the final answer. Units will be omitted until the final answer. Now recall the following: $$C_n = C_k \left(  \frac{I_n}{I_k} \right)  \;\; \text{and} \;\; C_A = C_B\left( \frac{S_A}{S_B} \right)  ^X$$
>To find our desired answer, we first calculate the estimate cost of the $250m^2$ event tent in $2024$. To do so, we use the first formula with inputs:
>- $n = 2024$
>- $k = 2014$
>- $C_k = 16\:000$
>- $I_n = 1\:059$
>- $I_k = 725$
>Thus: $$C_{2024} = 16\:000 \left( \frac{1\:059}{725 } \right) = 23\:371.0344$$With this, we estimate the price of the $150m^2$ tent using the second formula with inputs:
>- $C_B = C_{2024} = 23\:371.0344$
>- $S_A = 150$
>- $S_B = 250$
>- $X = 0.7$
>Thus: $$C_A = 23\:371.0344 \left( \frac{150}{250} \right)^{0.7} = 16\:344.9580$$Hence the final estimate cost of a $150m^2$ tent in 2024 is $\$16\:344.96$.
