The goal is to minimize the payback period (obviously). It should bever be used as the sole determinator for a project’s viability.

>[!def|*] Payback Period
>The payback period of a project is the number of years it takes for an investment to be recouped when the interest rate is assumed to be **zero**. With constant annual savings, we have: $$\text{Payback Period} = \frac{\text{First Cost}}{\text{Annual Savings}}$$
>**A two year payback period is considered acceptable while anything above four years is considered unacceptable** (The “do nothing option” can be used).

>[!exm|1]
>If a first cost of $\$20\:000$ yielded a return of $\$8\:000$ per year then the payback period would be: $$\text{Payback Period} = \frac{20\:000}{8\:000} = 2.5 \: \text{years}$$

If the annual savings are not constant, then we calculate the payback period by deducting each year of savings from the first cost until the first cost is covered (a so called discrete approach).

>[!claim|*] Advantages of the payback period
>1. It is easy to understand (allows for easy communication with managers or clients).
>2. It is easy to calculate (done quickly without a calculator).
>3. It accounts for the need to recover capitol quickly.
>4. As the future is unknown, it makes little sense to use precise methods with numbers that are imprecise to start with. Thus a simple method is preferrable.

>[!claim|*] Disadvantages of the payback period
>1. It discriminates against long-term projects. No houses or highways would ever be built if they had to pay themselves off in two years.
>2. It ignores the effect of the timing of cash flows within the payback period. It disregards [[Nominal and Effective Interest Rates|Interest Rates]] and ignores the [[Time Value of Money]]. 
>3. It ignores the expected service life and disregards benefits that accrue after the end of the payback period.
