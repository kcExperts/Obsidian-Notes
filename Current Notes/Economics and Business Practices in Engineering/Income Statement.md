>[!def|*] Income Statement
>The income statement reflects the result of the operations of a firm over a specified period of time. It records all the revenues and expenses for the given period and shows whether the firm is making a profit or a loss. Most often prepared in a multiyear format. The following receive the most importance:
>- **Net Sales**: Consists of the total sales minus allowances for returned goods and discounts.
>- **Cost of Sales**: Includes all the direct costs associated with producing or delivering a product or service, including the material costs and direct labor. 
>- **Operating Expenses**: Includes marketing, administrative costs, and other expenses not directly related to producing a product or service.

>[!rmk|*] Comparison of ratios
>The most valuable things that can be done with income statements is to compare the ratios of cost of sales and operating expenses to net sales for different periods. 
>- Taking the ratio of the cost of sales and the net sales ($\text{Cost of sales / Net sales}$) is healthy if the ratio decreases over time.
>- **Profit Margin**: Is a ratio that is of particular importance when evaluating a firm’s income statements: $$\text{Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Net Sales}}$$This represents in what percentage of every dollar in sales contributes to the bottom line. An increasing margin means that a firm is either boosting its sales without increasing its expenses or that it is doing a better job of controlling its costs. A declining margin means that a firm is losing control of its costs or that it is slashing prices to maintain or increase sales.
>- **Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)**: Is a simple ratio that measures the price of a company’s stock against its earnings. The higher it goes, the greater the market thinks the company will grow: $$\text{P/E} = \frac{\text{Price to trade the stock (stock listing price)}}{\text{Earnings per share}}$$
