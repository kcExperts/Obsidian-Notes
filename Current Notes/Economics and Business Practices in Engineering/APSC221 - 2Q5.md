>Let us go about calculating the expected values of each node to determine the best option where $EV_i$ denotes the expected value of the $i^{th}$ node. **The expected value of the node will include the decision cost with it. So, for example, the expected value of node $6$ will include the minor modification cost**: $$\begin{array}{ccc} EV_6 = 0.15(-150\:000)+0.45(-35\:000)+0.40(0) -5000 = -43\:250 \\ EV_5 = 0.05(-150\:000)+0.30(-35\:000)+0.65(0) - 30\:000 = -48\:000 \\  \end{array}$$Thus the best value for node $4$ is going with $EV_6$, hence: $$EV_4 = EV_6$$With this: $$EV_3 = 0.66(EV_4)+0.34(0) -50\:000= -78\:545$$Now for the no-test option: $$EV_2 = 0.55(-150\:000)+0.35(-35\:000)+0.10(0) =-94\:750$$Since $EV_3 < EV_2$, we have: $$EV_1 = EV_3$$Analyzing our values, the recommended action for Appalachian is as follows:
>1. Conduct tests;
>2. If the outcome is unfavorable, perform **minor modifications**.
