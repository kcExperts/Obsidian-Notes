In engineering, taxes cannot be ignored. They can be incorporated into computations using the before-tax [[Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return|MARR]]. 

>[!claim|*]- Basic Logic
>Recall that taxes can be considered a disbursement. Thus we need to ensure that an appropriate MARR is set for the project. If we do not explicitly account for the impact that taxes will have on the cash flows, then a high enough MARR needs to be set, that is what the before-tax MARR is.
>
>If, instead, the impact of MARR is explicitly accounted for in the cash flows, then the MARR used should be lower, since the cash flows already take into account the payment of taxes. This is the after-tax MARR.

>[!def|*] Before and After Tax MARR
>The **before-tax MARR** represents a high MARR that has been chosen to recognize the impact of taxes. 
>The **after-tar MARR** represents a lower MARR that is used as the cash flows already reflect the taxes (they have been explicitly calculated and taken into account).
>
>An approximate relationship between the two is given as: $$\text{MARR}_{\text{after-tax}} \approx \text{MARR}_{\text{before-tax}} \times (1-t)$$where $t$ is the **corporate tax rate**. In general, both MARRâ€™s are chosen independently and are not directly related by this equation.
>
>Note: If a MARR is given without specifying which type, one can assume it is a before-tax MARR.

>[!rmk|*] When to use which
>In general, if you are doing approximate calculation without taking taxes into account explicitly, use the before-tax MARR. When considering taxes explicitly, use the after-tax MARR.
