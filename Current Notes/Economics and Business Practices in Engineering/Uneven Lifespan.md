When using the [[Present Worth Method]], we must always use the same time period in order to take into account the full benefits and costs of each alternative. If the lives are not the same, they need to be transformed to an equal time frame. There are two methods to do this:

>[!claim|*] Method 1 - Repeated Lives
>Repeat the service life of each alternative to arrive at a common time period for all alternatives (find their LCM). Assume that each alternative can be repeated with the same costs and benefits in the future (assumption known as repeated lives). This approach is not feasible when expecting technological improvements.
>

Method $1$ is preferred and should be used when possible over method $2$.

>[!claim|*] Method 2
>Adopt a specific study period (which is a time period that is given for the analysis). This requires a certain guess about the salvage value of the object before its service life ends (needs to be estimated).
