>[!def|*] Risk Identification
>This is the process of determining the specific risk factors that can reasonable be expected to affect your project.

#### Risk Classification Clusters
Risks commonly fall into one or more of the following classification clusters:
- **Financial Risk**: Refers to the financial exposure that a firm opens up itself to when developing a project.
- **Technical Risk**: Refers to projects that contain unique technical elements or unproven technology that can lead to significant risk. The degree of the risk varies greatly; it can be negligeable or significant.
- **Commercial Risk**: Refers to projects that have been developed for a definite commercial intent (profitability). It is hard to predict the commercial success once the product has been introduced to the market place.
- **Execution Risk**: Refers to the specific unknowns related to the execution of the project plan. This can refer to the terrain that will be used (mountainous or rocky) all the way to poorly trained or insufficient project team personnel. This is a broad category that seeks to assess any unique circumstances or uncertainties that could have a negative impact on execution of the plan.
- **Contractual or Legal Risk**: Refers to project for which strict terms and conditions are drawn up in advance (and can be quite significant). Companies naturally seek to limit their legal exposure through legal protection, but it is sometimes impossible to pass along contractual risk to other parties (for example, U.S railroads will not accept penalty clauses for late deliveries as they have an almost monopolistic control of the market, hence organizations utilizing rail transportation must accept all delivery risk themselves).

#### Risk Factor Identification Methods
Many methods, both qualitative and quantitative, are available for conducting risk factor identification for industry-specific risks, including: 
- **Brainstorming meetings**
- **Expert opinion**
- **History**
- **Multiple (or team-based) assessments**
