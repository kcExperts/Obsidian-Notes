Taxes are fees paid by individuals or businesses to support their government. They are generally the primary source of revenue for a government and are used to fund public goods and services.

For business purposes, we can consider taxes to be a disbursement that scales with the amount of profit made.
- If an investment yields a profit, the profits will be taxed.
- If the investment yields a loss, the company can offset the loss against the profits of another investment and end up paying less tax overall.
