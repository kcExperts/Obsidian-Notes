The following image represents the needed ratio and formula:

Note that: 
$$\begin{array}{ccc}  \text{Average total assets} = \frac{\text{beginning total assets + ending total assets}}{2}\\ \text{Average shareholders' equity} = \frac{\text{beginning shareholder's equity + ending shareholders' equity}}{2}  \end{array}$$
In general, to evaluate the following, we use the given ratios:
- **Liquidity**: [[Balance Sheet|Working Capital Ratio]], [[Balance Sheet| Current Ratio]] and the Acid-Test Ratio which compares a company’s quick assets (cash and accounts receivable) to its current liabilities, telling us whether it has sufficient short-term assets to cover its immediate liabilities: $$\text{Acid-Test Ratio} = \frac{\text{Quick Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$$The Inventory turnover ratio is also used here. It is the rate that inventory stock is sold, or used, and replaced: $$\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Inventory}}$$
- **Profitability**: [[Income Statement| Profit Margin]], ROA (see image), which is the a ratio on how much profit a company can generate from its assets. A higher ratio is preferred as it means the company is more efficient and productive at managing its balance sheet to generate profits. Similarly, the ROE (see image) gauges the profitability and how efficiently it generates profit. A higher ROE means the company is better at converting its equity financing into profits.
- **Stability**: [[Balance Sheet| Debt Ratio]], [[Financial Objectives of a Firm| Debt to Equity Ratio]] and the Equity ratio, which represents how much of a company’s assets have been generated by issuing equity shares rather than taking on debt:$$\text{Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Equity}}{\text{Total Assets}}$$A low ratio means that the company primarily used debt to acquire assets, which is viewed as a financial risk. A higher ratio means that the company effectively funded its assets requirements with a minimal amount of debt. 


Most companies aim to have current ratio of around 2 and an acid test ratio of around 1. Depending on the context, a higher or lower number can be better. In a ratio analysis, always phrase it as “if the ratio is doing this, then that implies that the company could be…”
