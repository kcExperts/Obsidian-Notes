>[!def|*] Perfect Competition
>Perfect competition occurs when any given product is supplied by a large number of vendors and there is no restriction on additional suppliers entering the market. In this situation, there is guarantee of complete freedom on the part of the buyer and seller. However, in reality, perfect competition cannot exist.

>[!def|*] Perfect Monopoly
>Perfect monopolies occur when a unique product or service is only available from a single supplier and the seller can prevent all other businesses from entering the market. These rarely occur in practice but some examples do exist such as the De Beers diamond monopoly during much of the 20th century.
