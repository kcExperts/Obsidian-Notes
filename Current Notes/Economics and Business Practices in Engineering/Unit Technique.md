The unit technique involves using per unit factors that can be estimated effectively. Essentially, you would be doing unit conversion until you get to a dollar amount. Some common methods are shown below:
- Capital cost of plant per kilowatt of capacity
- Revenue per mile
- Capital cost per installed telephone
- Revenue per customer served
- Temperature loss per $1\:000$ feet of steam pipe
- Operating cost per mile
- Construction cost per square foot

Multiplying these factors by appropriate units should give you a total estimate cost, saving or revenue.
