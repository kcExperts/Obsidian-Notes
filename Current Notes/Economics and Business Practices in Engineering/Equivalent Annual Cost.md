>[!def|*] Equivalent Annual Cost
>The equivalent annual cost (EAC) is the annual worth calculation in the context of a replacement study. It is basically nothing more than the annual worth approach with a different name adopted for use in the replacement studies.

A formula (although there exist others) to calculate the EAC is: $$\text{EAC} = \text{EAC(capital costs)} + \text{EAC(operating and maintenance)}$$$$\text{EAC(capital costs)} = (P-S)(A/P,i,N)+Si$$where:
- $\text{EAC(capital costs)} =$ annualized capital costs for an $N$-year replacement period;
- $P =$ purchase price;
- $S =$ salvage value of the asset at the end of $N$ years.
- **If installation costs exist, then we get $(P+I-S)$.

>[!def|*] Economic Life
>The economic life of an asset is the service life that minimizes the average cost of using the asset. In other words, it is the number of years that minimizes the $\text{EAC(capital costs)}$.
