>[!def|*] Current IRR
>The current [[Internal Rate of Return|IRR]] of a project $\text{IRR}_C$, is the rate of return of the project on the basis of the [[Real and Actual Dollars|Actual Dollars]] cash flows. It is found by solving for $i^*$ in: $$\sum^T_{t=0} \frac{A_t}{(1_C + i^*)^t} = 0$$Where:
>- $A_t$ is the current cash flow in period $t$.
>- $T$ is the number of time periods.
>- $i^*$ is the actual internal rate of return.

>[!def|*] Real IRR
>The real IRR $\text{IRR}_R$ is the rate of return obtained on the [[Real and Actual Dollars|Real Dollars]] cash flows associated with the project. It is obtained by solving for $i'$ in: $$\sum^T_{t=0} \frac{R_t}{(1_A + i^*)^t} = 0$$

>[!rmk|*] Relationship between the real and current IRR
>The relationship is: $$\text{IRR}_A=\text{IRR}_R+f+(\text{IRR}_R \cdot f)$$

Again, this works using the MARR.
