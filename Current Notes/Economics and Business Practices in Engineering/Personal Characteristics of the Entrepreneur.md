There are four main characteristics of the entrepreneur:

>[!def|*] Prior Experience
>As our experiences are a fundamental part on how our brain makes decisions, it will play a role in identifying opportunities. Work places a great place to find opportunities, but also a strong inhibitor at the same time.
>- With careful observation and experience we can notice what products and processes lack  
and how they could be made better.
>- The processes of work also want us to be compliant in the way we work so that the overall  
system can be as efficient as possible. This can blind us to doing things the way they have  
always been done.
> - Every successful product and process is the result of thousands of small incremental  
decisions. Many of those “choices” along the path were based on underlying assumptions  
or data that may now no longer be valid.
>
>We need to be aware of our biases so that we can take a look at old problems from new perspectives, generate new ideas and identify opportunities.

>[!def|*] Cognitive Factors
>This refers to the ability to notice things without deliberately looking for it. One might call this a “sixth-sense”. Alterness is alrgely a learned skill and people who have more knowledge of an area tend to be more alert to opportunities.

>[!def|*] Social Networks
>Refers to the extend and depth of an individual’s social network which will have an effect on opportunity recognition. People who build networks will be exposed to more ideas. Research suggests that between $40\%$ and $50\%$ of people who start a business got their idea via a social contact.
>- **Strong-Tie**: A strong-tie relationship is characterized by frequent interaction and form between coworkers, friends, and spouses.
>- **Weak-Tie**: A weak-tie relationship is characterized by infrequent interaction and form between casual acquaintances.
>  
>From this, it is more likely that we get business ideas through **weak-tie** relationships. As you do not know these people, they are likely to be less like-minded individuals, so you would hear things that would be outside your usual perspective.
>

>[!def|*] Creativity
>Creativity is the process of generating a novel or useful idea. The creative process can be broken into five stages. 
>1. **Preparation**: Preparation is the background, experience, and knowledge that an entrepreneur brings to the opportunity recognition process. 
>2. **Incubation**: Incubation is the stage during which a person considers an idea or thinks about a problem, it is the “mulling things over” phase. It can be either a conscious or unconscious activity. 
>3. **Insight**: Insight is the flash of recognition when the solution to a problem is seen or an idea is born. Referred to as the “eureka” moment. 
>4. **Evaluation**: Evaluation is the stage for which we scrutinize and analyze the idea to determine its viability. This is not easy to do as it requires you to take a candid look at the viability of an idea. 
>5. **Elaboration**: Elaboration is the stage in which the idea is put into its final form: The details are worked out and the idea is transformed into something of value.
