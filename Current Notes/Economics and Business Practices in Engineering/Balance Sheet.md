Whereas the [[Income Statement]] covers a specified period of time, a balance sheet is a snapshot of a company’s assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity at a specific point in time. Note: $$\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity}$$

>[!def|*] Balance Sheet
>Depending on how it is shown, the left-hand side of a balance sheet shows a firm’s assets. The assets are listed **in order of their liquidity**. The liabilities are listed **in the order in which they must be paid**. A balance sheet must always balance, meaning that a firm’s assets must always equal its liabilities plus owners’ equity. 

>[!rmk|*]- Major assets categories
>- **Current Assets**: Include cash plus items that are readily convertible to cash, such as accounts receivable, marketable securities, and inventories.
>- **Fixed assets**: Are assets used over a longer time frame, such as real estate, buildings, equipment, and furniture.
>- **Other assets**: Are miscellaneous assets, including accumulated goodwill.

>[!rmk|*]- Major liabilities categories
>- **Current liabilities**: Include obligations that are payable within a year, including accounts payable, accrued expenses, and the current portion of long-term debt.
>- **Long-term liabilities**: Include notes or loans that are repayable beyond one year, including liabilities associated with purchasing real estate, buildings, and equipment.
>- **Owners’ equity**: Is the equity invested in the business by its owner plus the accumulated earnings retained by the business after paying dividends.

>[!rmk|*]- Balance Sheets are Deceiving
>- A company’s assets are recorded at cost rather than fair market value. For example, if they bought a property for $\$1$ million a few years ago and it has increased in value, the balance sheet will still have the $\$1$ million put instead of the actual market price.
>- Intellectual property, such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights, receive value on the balance sheet in some cases and in some cases they don’t (depending on circumstances involved). In many cases, a firm’s intellectual property will receive no value on its balance sheet. 
>- The goodwill that a firm has accumulated is not reported on its balance sheet. 

>[!def|*] Primary Questions
>When evaluating a balance sheet, two primary questions are:
>1. Does the firm have sufficient short-term assets to cover its short-term debts?
>2. Is the firm financially sound overall?
>
>To answer these questions, we introduce:
>- **Working Capital**: $$\text{Working capital} = \text{Current assets} - \text{Current liabilities}$$This number represents the amount of liquid assets the firm has available which helps answer the first question.
>- **Current Ratio**: $$\text{Current ratio} = \frac{\text{Current assets}}{\text{Current liabilities}}$$This tells us more about the firm’s ability to pay its short-term debts, helping to answer the first question. The ratio signifies that for every $n$ amount of dollars in current assets, it has $\$1$ in current liabilities.
> 
> Computing a firm’s overall debt ratio will give us an answer to the second question.
>- **Debt Ratio**: $$\text{Debt ratio} = \frac{\text{Total debt}}{\text{Total assets}}$$This means that $n$ percent of its total assets are financed by debt and the remaining is financed by the owners' equity. $n \approx 40$ is a healthy number for a new firm. In general, less debt creates more freedom for the entrepreneurial firm in terms of taking different actions.
