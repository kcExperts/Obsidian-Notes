Single disbursement or receipt represents a one time use of money that is gained or lost. Think of it as a single investment today that wants to be retrieved in the future. Both of the formulas can be derived using $F = P(1+i)^N$.

>[!def|*] Compound Amount Factor
>The compound amount factor $(F/P,i,N)$ gives the future amount $F$, that is equivalent to a present amount $P$, when the interest rate is $i$ and the number of periods is $N$. In other words, it is the number that we need to multiply $P$ by to get $F$, hence: $$(F/P,i,N) = (1+i)^N$$

>[!def|*] Present Worth Factor
>The present worth factor $(P/F,i,N)$ gives $P$ knowing $F$ (and $i$ and $N$). Hence: $$(P/F,i,N) = \frac{1}{(1+i)^N}$$
