>Let me be clear, the wording of the question heavily confuses me and I do not really know what it is asking. I am going to **assume** that the question wants me to find the maximum EAC of the new roller conveyor system that would make it a justifiable to replace the old system within the next $3$ years, considering a MARR of $10\%$.

>Let us find the EAC of the next $3$ years.
>We will start by finding the EAC from the current year (assume that the present is year $0$). Before that, the salvage value for this year is $33\:000(1-0.12) = \$29040$, thus: $$\begin{array}{ccc} \text{EAC}_{\text{capital}}(1) = (33\:000- 29040 )(A/P,10\%,1) + 29040(0.1) =\$7260 \\ \text{EAC}_{\text{O\&M}}(1) = \$3400 \\ \text{EAC}(1) =\$10\:660 \end{array}$$
>The salvage value for the second year is $33\:000(1-0.12)^2 = \$25\:555.20$, thus: $$\begin{array}{ccc} \text{EAC}_{\text{capital}}(2) = (33\:000-25\:555.20)(A/P,10\%,2)+25\:555.20(0.1) = \$6845.21 \\ \text{EAC}_{\text{O\&M}}(2) = 3400+500(P/G,10\%,2)(A/P,10\%,2) = \$3638.09  \\ \text{EAC}(2) = \$10\:483.3\end{array}$$The salvage value for the third year is $33\:000(1-0.12)^3 = \$22\:488.58$, thus:  $$\begin{array}{ccc} \text{EAC}_{\text{capital}}(3) = (33\:000-22\:488.58)(A/P,10\%,3)+22\:488.58(0.1) = \$6475.50 \\ \text{EAC}_{\text{O\&M}}(3) = 3400+500(P/G,10\%,3)(A/P,10\%,3) = \$3868.27\\ \text{EAC}(3) = \$10\:343.77\end{array}$$Thus the **new roller conveyor system** should have an EAC of less than $10\:343.77$ to justify a replacement within the next $3$ years. 

>[!claim|*] Solution to part B
>Step $1$ requires the EAC of the challenger, which is $\$10\:300$. Step $2$ needs us to get the remaining EAC of the defender, which we have already determined (in part A) to be $\$10\:343.77$ (for the next $3$ years). Step $3$ says that if the EAC of the defender is greater than the EAC of the challenger, than we must replace the defender now. Since this holds true in our case, the old system should be replaced immediately.

>[!claim|*] Solution to part C
>Here we will continue to calculate the EAC of the defender assuming that the value continues to depreciate at $12\%$ of its value each year. To do so, I have written a Desmos program to output the EAC of each year given some $N$: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/mqckzksvl0
>
>From this, we have: $$\begin{array}{ccc}  EAC(4) =\$10\:236.96\\ EAC(5)=\$10\:157.82\\ EAC(6)= \$10\:102.55 \\ EAC(7) = \$10\:067.66 \\ EAC(8) = \$10\:050.11 \\ EAC(9) = \$10\:047.23  \; \; \;\text{(minimized)}\\ EAC(10)=\$ 10\:056.66 \\ EAC(16) = \$10\:273.89\\ EAC(17) = \$10\:324.83 \end{array}$$As we can see, $17$ years from now, the EAC of the defender will be higher than the EAC of the challenger. Hence **it is** necessary to consider replacing the old conveyor system more than $3$ years from now, given that the new one has an EAC of $\$10\:300$.
