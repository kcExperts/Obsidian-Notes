>[!def|*] Inflation Rate
>The inflation rate is the rate of increase in average prices of goods and services over a specified period of time (usually a year).

Since inflation doesn’t affect every good or service equally during the same time period, extra work needs to be done. 

>[!def|*] Consumer Price Index
>Economists define a representative set of goods and services that most people use and track how many items in that “basket” increase or decrease in price. This basket forms the basis for the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI for a given period relates the average price of a fixed basket of these goods in the given period to the average price of the equivalent basket in a base year. We have: $$\text{CPI} = 100 \left( \frac{\text{Current \$}}{\text{Base year \$}} \right) $$

>[!exm|*] CPI
>Suppose that a product cost $\$100$ in 2002 and that the CPI in March 2024 is $159.8$. Then the price of that product today would be $\$159.8$ as: $$\text{Current \$} = \frac{\text{CPI}}{\text{100}} \cdot \text{Base year \$} = \frac{159.8}{100} \cdot 100 = \$159.8$$
