>Let the annual worth of the landfill site be denoted as $W_L$ and the annual worth of the transportation method be denoted as $W_T$. A negative value means that it will cost the city of Halifax. Thus: $$W_L = -1\:000\:000(A/P,11\%,30) - 100\:000(A/F,11\%,30)-20\:000+x$$Where $x$ is the annual worth of the income from the landfill site. To find it, we compute the following: $$x =\big([30\:000(P/A,11\%,20)](P/F,11\%,10) \big ) \cdot(A/P,11\%,30) = \$9\:676.13$$Thus: $$W_L = -\$115\:000-\$290-\$20\:000+\$9\:676.13 = -\$125\:613.87$$
>$W_T$ is trivial to calculate: $$W_L = -\$130\:000.00$$We can clearly see that, using the annual worth method, the development of a landfill site would cost the city less dollars per year compared to transporting the waste. Hence, **developing a landfill site is the economically preferred option**.
