Here we explore how we write a business plan. The sections are presented in order.

>[!rmk|*]- Cover Letter - Unneeded unless sent to an investor
>The cover letter should accompany a business plan sent to an investor or other stakeholders. The cover letter should briefly introduce the entrepreneur and clearly state why the business plan is being sent to the individual receiving it. 

>[!def|*] Cover Page
>- The cover page should include the company’s name, address, and phone number; the date; the contact information for the lead entrepreneur; and the company’s website address if it has one. The company’s social networking pages can also be included. 
>- The contact information should include an e-mail address, a smart phone number, and a landline number if they have one. This information should be centered at the top of the page. 
>- The bottom of the page should include information alerting the reader to the confidential nature of the plan. If the company has a distinctive trademark, it should be placed there. 

>[!def|*] Table Of Contents (**Not to be included in assignment**)
>- The table of contents should follow the cover letter. It should list the sections and page numbers of the business plan and the appendices.

>[!def|*] Executive Summary
>- The executive summary is a short overview of the entire business plan. It provides the reader with everything to know about the new venture’s distinctive nature. 
>- This section should **not be an introduction or preface to the plan**; instead, it is meant to be a summary of the plan itself.
>- Because of the nature of the summary, it should be written *last* as the plan itself will evolve while being written.

Now we get to the main body:

>[!def|*] Industry Analysis
>- This section describes the industry in which the firm intends to compete. This description should include data and information about various characteristics of the industry, such as its size, growth rate, and sales projections.
>- It is important to focus on the business’s industry and not its industry and target market simultaneously. After all, before a business selects a target market, it should have a good grasp of its industry, including where the industry’s promising areas are and its points of vulnerability. 
>- *Industry Structure* refers to how concentrated or fragmented an industry is. Fragmented industries are more receptive to new entrants. 
>- Providing the reader with a feel for the nature of the participants in the industry is also important. Do the competitors innovate? How will your firm fill the gap?
>- Most industries have 6 to 10 key factors in which all participants must establish competence. Explain how your business excels in some of these factors. 
>- *Industry Trends* should be discussed. The most important ones being: economic, social, technological, political and regulatory trends. Business trends include issues such as if the profit margin is increasing or decreasing.
>- The industry analysis should conclude with a brief statement of your beliefs regarding the long-term prospects for the industry.

>[!def|*] Company Description
>- This section begins with a general description of the company. 
>- The company history should be brief, but should explain the origin of the idea and the driving force behind it. 
>- The *mission statement* defines why a company exists and what it aspires to become. If done right, it can serve as its financial and moral compass and serve as an anchor for which decisions are made. 
>- A tagline is also sometimes include. It is a phrase that a business plans to use to reinforce its position in the marketplace. 
>- The *product and services section* should be an explanation of the product or service. Including how it is unique and how it will position itself in the market. A products position is how it is situated relative to its rivals. 
>- The *current status* section should reveal how far along your company is in its development. Milestones are a good way to put this. Getting a name, completing a feasibility analysis and so on can be considered milestones.
>- The *legal status and ownership* section should indicate who owns the business and how it is split up. 

>[!def|*] Market Analysis
>- Whereas the industry analysis focuses on the industry, the market analysis breaks the industry into segments and zeroes in on the specific segment (target market) to which the firm will try to appeal. 
>- First we need to complete a market segmentation, which is the process of separating the market into distinct parts, either by geography, service etc.…
>- A section that deals directly with the behavior of the consumers in a firm’s target market is critical. 
>- A *competitor analysis*, which is a detailed analysis of a firm’s competitors, should be included.
>- The final section of the market analysis estimates a firm’s annual sales and market share. There are four methods to do this, shown in the image below:

>[!def|*] Economics of the Business
>- This section begins the financial analysis of a business, which is further fleshed out in the financial projections. It aims to address the basic logic of how profits are earned and how many units must be sold to break even and start earning a profit. 
>- Major revenue drivers should be identified. The *contribution margin*, which is the amount of profit made from a sale when factoring in the cost to produce the good, should be found for every product. For multiple products in a single category, calculate the contribution margins for each and take the average. 
>- The next section should provide an analysis of the business’s fixed and variable costs. The variable costs (costs of goods sold) for each revenue driver was figured previously. Add a projection of the business’s fixed costs. 
>- A firm’s *operating leverage* should be analyzed next. It is an analysis of its fixed versus variable costs. Operating leverages is highest in companies that have a high proportion of fixed cost relative to their variable costs. The implication of this should be discussed. For example, a firm with high operating leverage takes longer to reach break-even. However, once it does break-even, more of its revenues fall to the bottom line. 
>- The business’s one-time start up costs should be estimated and placed into a table. These costs include legal expenses, fees for business licenses and permits, website design and so on.
>- This section concludes with a break-even analysis.

>[!def|*] Marketing Plan
>- This section focuses on how the business will market and sell its product or service. It deals with the marketing in terms of price, promotion, distribution, and sales. 
>- The best way to describe a company’s marketing plan it to start by articulating its marketing strategy, positioning, and points of differentiation, and then talk about how these overall aspects of the plan will be supported by price, promotional mix and sales process, and distribution strategy. In a short plan, it is hard to talk about this effectively, but these points should be present.
>- A firm’s *marketing strategy* refers to its overall approach for marketing its products and services. It is described by the previous point.
>- The next section deals with the approach to product, price, promotion, and distribution. If the product has already been adequately explained already, move directly to price. Also briefly discuss the plans regarding promotions and distribution.
>- The final section should describe the company’s sales process or cycle and specific sales tactics it will employ. 

>[!def|*] Operations Plan
>- This section outlines how the business will be run and how the product or service will be produced. A careful balance between adequately describing this topic and providing too much detail is required. The readers just want an overall sense on how the business will be run.
>- First articulate the general approach to operations in terms of what’s most important and what the make-or-break issues are. Then frame it in terms of the behind-the-scenes activities and the front stage (what the customer sees). 
>- Next, describe the geographic location of the business. Also describe the firm’s facilities and equipment. List the most important facilities and equipment and briefly explain how they will be (or have been) acquired. If they are to be bought, provide some details on the how. If the facilities are nondescript (such as generic workspace for programmers), it is not necessary to give a detailed explanation. 

>[!def|*] Management Team and Company Structure
>- Many investors and others first look at the executive summary then come here to assess the strength of the people starting the firm. 
>- The management team of a new firm typically consists of the founder(s) and a handful of key management personnel. A brief profile of each member should be provided, starting with the firm’s founder(s). Each profile should have: Title of the position, Duties and responsibilities, Previous industry and related experience, Previous successes and Educational Background. These should be brief and illustrate why each individual is qualified.
>- Certain attributes should also be highlighted (if they do apply). Investors and others tend to prefer team members who have worked together before. Identify gaps in the management system as well and how they will be filled. 
>- The final portion focuses on how the company will be structured. Outline how the company is currently structured and how it will be structured as it grows. It needs to make sense.
