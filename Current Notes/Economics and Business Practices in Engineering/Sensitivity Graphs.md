These illustrate a **single** measure to a change in **one** uncertain parameter.

>[!def|*] Sensitivity Graph
>A sensitivity graph is used to assess the effect of a one-at-a-time change in key parameter values of a project on an economic performance measure.

Usually, we begin with a “base case” where all the estimated parameter values are used to evaluate the PW, AW or [[Internal Rate of Return|IRR]] of a project. We then vary a single parameter (keeping all others fixed) and see how the performance changes. 

Pros:
- Used to select key parameters in analysis.
- Easy to understand and communicated in a single diagram.

Cons:
- Valid only over the specified range of parameter values.
- **Does not consider interactions between parameters**.
