>[!def|*] Analysis of Probability and Consequences
>This refers to the potential impact of risk factors, determined by how likely they are to occur and the effect they would have on the project if they did occur. Let $RF$ be the risk factor, then: $$RF = P_f + C_f - (P_f)(C_f)$$Where $P_f$ and $C_f$ are the probability and consequences of failure. The rule of thumb is:
>- **Low Risk**: $RF < 0.3$
>- **Medium Risk**: $0.3 < RF \le 0.7$
>- **High Risk**: $0.7 < RF$

The main idea when analysis risk is to combine the probability and the consequences of the risk. This produces the following **idea**: $$\text{Risk} = \text{Probability of the Event}\: \times \:\text{Impact of the Event}$$One can use a $2 \times 2$ matrix with likelihood on the vertical, from low to high, and consequences on the horizontal, from low to high, to organize the risks. Giving numbers to the probability of an event and the impact can be quite difficult. Below is a table that allows quantification:
