Up until now, we have assumed that prices, interest rates and the magnitude and timing of cash flows have known precise values. In reality, there is a certain uncertainty associated with each parameter. Since these parameters can vary under the effect of other unknown parameters, it is important to know how *sensitive* they are to change (such as new technology being developed). 

>[!def|*] Sensitivity Analysis
>Sensitivity Analysis is an approach to project evaluation that can be used to gain a better understanding of how uncertainty affects the outcome of the evaluation by examining how sensitive the outcome is to changes in the uncertain parameters. It letâ€™s engineers know whether it is worth it to get more detailed data as part of an evaluation. 

>[!def|*] Risk
>The term risk is often used to refer to the probability distribution of outcomes associated with a project, or the probability of an undesirable outcome (the last part is not used in this course but is commonly used in financial literature).

We will explore the following:
