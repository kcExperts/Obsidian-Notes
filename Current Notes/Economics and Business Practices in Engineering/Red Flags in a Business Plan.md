A business, to make the best impressions, should follow a conventional structure for their business plan. 

>[!rmk|*] Red Flags in a Business Plan
>1. **Founders with none of their own money at risk**: If the founders aren’t willing to put their own money at risk, why should anyone else?
>2. **A poorly cited plan**: A plan should be built on the hard evidence and sound research, not guesswork or what an entrepreneur “thinks” will happen. The sources for all primary and secondary research should be cited.”
>3. **Defining the market size too broadly**: Defining a broad market size means that the true target market has not been clearly identified. Saying that a venture will target the music industry is not helpful. Obviously, the venture will target a segment or a specific market within the industry.
>4. **Overly aggressive financials**: Many investors skip directly to this portion of the plan. Projections that are poorly reasoned or unrealistically optimistic lose credibility. 
>5. **Sloppiness in any area**: Simple mistakes are seen as inattention to detail and hurt the entrepreneur’s credibility.
