We present some ways to generate ideas:

>[!def|*] Focus groups
>A focus group is a gathering of around $5$ to $10$ people who have been selected based on their common characteristics relative to the issues being discussed. This works as no one person can think of everything themselves and having a single perspective around an opportunity can be disastrous. A focus group provides different perspectives, insights and opinions.

>[!def|*] Library Research
>Libraries contain underutilized sources of information. The best approach is to talk to a reference librarian, who can point out useful resources and then browse through them until an idea is formed.

>[!def|*] Internet Research
>Self-explanatory, but just be very careful about the credibility of the material. Finding the same information on multiple websites **does not** make the information credible.
