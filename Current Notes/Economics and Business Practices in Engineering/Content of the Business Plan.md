The business plan should give clear and concise information on all important aspects of the proposed venture. It must be long enough to provide sufficient information and short enough to maintain reader interest. For most, 25 to 35 (leaning closer to 25) pages are sufficient.

A main question is “How long and detailed should it be?”. The answer depends on the type of plan being written. There are three main types presented below:

>[!def|*] Summary Business Plan
>It is a 10 to 15 page document that works best for companies that are *very* early in their development and are not prepared to write a full plan. Experienced entrepreneurs also use this as they don’t want to take the time to write a detailed report. In general, it is used for companies that want to “test the waters” to see if investors are interested.

>[!def|*] Full Business Plan
>It is a 25 to 35 page document. This type of plan spells out a company’s operations and plans in much more detail than a summary business plan, and it is the format that is usually used to prepare a business plan for an investor.

>[!def|*] Operational Business Plan
>It is a 40 to 100 page document mainly used for an internal audience; works best as a tool for creating a blueprint for a new venture’s operations and providing guidance to operational managers.

See [[Outline of the Business Plan]] for the description of each section.
