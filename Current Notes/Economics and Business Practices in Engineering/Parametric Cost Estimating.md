This technique consists of using historical cost data and statistical techniques to predict future costs. Statistical techniques are used to develop Cost Estimating Relationships (CERs) that tie the cost or price of an item to one or more independent variables (cost drivers).

Parametric models are used in early design stages to get an idea of how much it will cost on the basis of physical attributes. There are multiple ways to develop a CER. [[Power-sizing Technique]] and the [[Learning Curve Model]] are two methods.
