>[!def|*] Capital Tax Factor (CTF)
>The CTF is a value that summarizes the effect of the benefit of future tax savings due to [[Capital Cost Allowance System|CCA]] and allows analysists to take these benefits into account when calculating the PW equivalent of an asset. For a given CCA rate, the CTF is constant: $$\text{CTF} = 1 - \frac{td(1+\frac{i}{2})}{(i+d)(1+i)}$$where:
>- $t$ is the taxation rate;
>- $d$ is the CCA rate;
>- $i$ is the after-tax interest rate.
>  
>  Note: CTF assumes infinite life of the asset.

>[!def|*] Capital Salvage Factor (CSF)
>The CSF represents the immediate effect that occurs when the asset is salvaged or scrapped. Note that the half-year rule does not apply here: $$\text{CSF} = 1 - \frac{td}{(i+d)}$$where:
>- $t$ is the taxation rate;
>- $d$ is the CCA rate;
>- $i$ is the after-tax interest rate.
>  
>  Note: This has implications if the salvage value is zero.
