Financial management deals with two activities: raising money and managing a company’s finances in a way that achieves the highest rate of return. Most entrepreneurial firms have four main financial objectives:

>[!def|*] Profitability
>It is the ability to earn a profit. During their first 1 to 3 years, a business is usually not profitable. They must become so to remain viable and to provide a return to its owners.

>[!def|*] Liquidity
>It is the ability for a company to meet its short-term financial obligations. Even if it is profitable, there are chances that it will not have the needed cash on hand to pay off a debt. To ensure that they can, a firm keeps close watch on accounts receivable and inventories. A company’s **accounts receivable** is that is owed to the company by its customers. Its **inventory** is its merchandise… waiting to be sold. If any of these numbers get too high, it may not have sufficient cash on hand to meet its short-term obligations

>[!def|*] Efficiency
>It is how productively a firm utilizes its assets relative to its revenue and profit. For example, minimizing the time a plane is on the ground instead of in the air is a productive use of its assets.

>[!def|*] Stability
>It is the strength and vigor of the firm’s overall financial posture. For a firm to be stable, it must not only earn a profit and remain liquid but also keep a **good debt-to-equity ratio (lower the better)**.
>

>[!rmk|*] Debt-to-Equity Ratio
>The debt-to-equity ratio, if too high, means that the company may have trouble meeting its obligations and securing the level of financing needed to fuel its growth: $$\text{Debt-to-equity ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Owner's Equity}}$$
