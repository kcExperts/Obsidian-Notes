>[!def|*] Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return
>The minimum acceptable rate of return (MARR), also known as the hurdle rate, is an interest rate that must be earned for the project to be approved. In other words, it is the lowest rate of return that the project must earn in order to offset the costs of the investment.

We must also assume, for our analysis purposes, that there is an option where money can be invested elsewhere and can achieve the MARR. This option is called the “do nothing option”. We will assume that the MARR is given.
