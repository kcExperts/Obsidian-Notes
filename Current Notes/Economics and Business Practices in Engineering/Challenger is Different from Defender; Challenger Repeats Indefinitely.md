The decision rule that minimizes cost in the case where a defender is faced by a challenger that is expected to be followed by a sequence of identical challengers is as follows:
1. Determine the economic life of the challenger and its associated [[Equivalent Annual Cost|EAC]].
2. Determine the remaining economic life of the defender and its associated EAC.
3. If the EAC of the defender is greater than the EAC of the challenger, replace the defender now. Otherwise, do not replace now.
