>[!def|*] Index
>An index is a dimensionless number that indicates how a cost or a price has changed with time with respect to a base year.

An estimate of the cost or selling price of an item in year $n$ can be obtained by multiplying the cost or price of the item at an earlier point in time (year $k$) by the ratio of the index value in year $n$ to the index value in year $k$. Thus: $$C_n = C_k \left(  \frac{I_n}{I_k} \right) $$
Where:
- $k$ is the reference year for which cost or price of item is known.
- $n$ is the year for which cost or price is to be estimated $(n > k$)
- $C_n$ is the estimated cost or price of the item in year $n$
- $C_k$ is the cost or price of the item in year $k$.

Note that the division of ratios is necessary to get a “factor” of how much the ratio has risen or fallen at year $k$ when compared to year $n$.

>A certain index for the cost of purchasing and installing utility boilers is keyed to 1988, where its baseline value was arbitrarily set at $100$. Company XYZ installed a boiler for $\$525\:000$ in 2000 when the index had a value of $468$. This same company must install another boiler of the same size in 2017. The index in 2017 is $542$. What is the approximate cost of the new boiler?

>[!claim|*] Solution
>We have the following:
>- $k = 2000 \implies C_k = \$525\:000 \; \land \; I_k = 468$
>- $n = 2017 \implies I_n = 542$
>Applying the formula nets: $$C_n = 525\:000 \left(  \frac{542}{468} \right)  = \$608\:012.82$$
