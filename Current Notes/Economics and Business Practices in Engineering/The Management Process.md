>[!def|*] Management
>**Management** is the process of planning, organizing, leading, and controlling an enterprise’s financial, physical, human, and information resources to achieve the organization’s goals. 

We note:
1. Planning, organizing, leading, and controlling aspects of a manager’s job are interrelated.
2. Management effectiveness $\ne$ management efficiency. *Efficiency* means achieving the greatest level of output with a given input (doing things right). *Effectiveness* means achieving organizational goals that have been set (doing the right thing). Note that it is likely for effectiveness $\implies$ efficiency. 

>[!def|*] Planning
>It is the process of determining the firm’s goals and developing a strategy to reach them. There are five steps (*done by the manager)*:
>1. Set the goals (*what*);
>2. Identify gaps between firm’s desires and position (gap analysis);
>3. Develop a plan (*how*);
>4. Implement the plan;
>5. Assess the effectiveness of the plan.

>There are layers to the plans being put in place, they are described below:
>- **Strategic plan** (3 to 10+ years): It is a long range plan and should reflect company priorities and strategic goals.
>- **Tactical plans** (1 to 5 years): A shorter term plan that implements a specific aspect of a strategic plan.
>- **Operational plan** (now to 2 years): It is the “day-to-day” activities that realize tactical plans.
