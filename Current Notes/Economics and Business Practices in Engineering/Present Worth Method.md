>[!def|*] Present Worth Method
>This method consists of comparing project $A$ and project $B$ by computing the present worth of the projects at the [[Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return|MARR]]. The preferred project is the one with the greatest present worth. 

Thus any [[Annuity]] and future worth/cost must be transformed into a present worth/cost.

>[!claim|*] PW for Independent Projects 
>The alternative to investing in an independent project is to do nothing. Taking this option assumes the MARR is reached. The project to be chosen achieves the highest worth.

>[!claim|*] PW for Mutually Exclusive Projects
>Compute the PW of each project using the MARR. The project with the most worth should be chosen.
