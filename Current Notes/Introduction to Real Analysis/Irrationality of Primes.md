One of the most fundamental ideas in mathematics are [[Prime Numbers]]. They have numerous properties. Here, we show that there no $q \in \mathbb Q$ that satisfies the equation $\sqrt p = q$  $\;\forall \; p$ primes. 

>[!theorem|*]- The square root of a prime number is irrational
>`\begin{proof}` Suppose $\exists \; q \in \mathbb{Q} \; : q^2 = 2$. As $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, it can be written in the form $q = \frac{a}{b}$: $a,b \in \mathbb{Z} \; \land \; \text{gcd}(a,b) = 1$. Thus: $q^2 = 2 \implies \frac{a}{b}^2 = 2 \implies \frac{a^2}{b^2} = 2 \implies a^2 = 2b^2 \implies 2|a^2 \implies 2|a$ by the definition of [[Divisibility]] $\; \land \;$ as $2$ is prime. Thus: $2n = a : n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and we have:
$a^2 = 2b^2 \implies 2a^2 = b^2 \implies 2|b^2 \implies 2|b$.
We have $2|a \; \land \; 2|b$, thus the $\text{gcd}(a,b) \ne 1$ giving us a contradiction.
`\end{proof}`

With this, we must now ask ourselves; how do we construct the [[Reals|Real Numbers]]? For this, we will need to examine [[Bounds]].
