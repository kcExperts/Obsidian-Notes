>[!def|*] Subsequences
>Let $a_n$ be a sequence and $n_k$ be a strictly decreasing sequence of natural numbers, Define $b_k$ by $b_k = a_{n_k}$, then $b_k$ is a subsequence of $a_n$.

>[!rmk|*] Specifications
> - The terms in $a_{n_k}$ are ordered in the same way as they were in $a_n$. 
> - No “repeated” in $a_{n_k}$ since $n_{k+1} > n_k$.
> - We always have $n_k \ge k$ where $k \in \mathbb{N}$
> - If $a_n$ is infinite, then $\exists \; a_{n_k}$ that has infinite terms. 

We also have the notion of converging subsequences:

>[!definition|*] Subsequential Limit
>Let $a_{n_k}$ be a converging subsequence: $a_{n_k} \rightarrow L_k$, then it is called the subsequential limit of $a_n$. 

With this, we move on to the [[Convergent Subsequences Theorem]]. A useful theorem.
