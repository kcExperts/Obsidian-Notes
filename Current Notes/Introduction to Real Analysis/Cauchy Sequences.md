The following definition bears a striking resemblance to the definition of a [[Converging Sequences|Converging Sequence]]. 

>[!def|*] Cauchy Sequence
>A sequence is called Cauchy if: $$\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \; N \in \mathbb{N}: |a_n - a_m| < \epsilon \; \; \; \forall \; n,m \ge N$$This means that for some terms $a_n : n \ge N$, all the terms after will get closer to each other given some $\epsilon$. 

Our goal is to show that $a_n \rightarrow L \iff a_n$ is Cauchy. The remarkable aspect about this theorem is that a Cauchy sequence makes no reference to a limit. One can say it resembles the idea behind the [[Monotone Convergence Theorem]]. Let us prove the [[Cauchy Criterion]].
