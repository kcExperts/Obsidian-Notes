We start with examples, attempting to determine if they are open, closed, clopen or neither.

>[!exm|1] 
>Consider: $$A = \{(x_1,x_2)\in \mathbb{R}^2 : x_2 = 0, 0 < x_1 < 1\} $$
>Determine if it is open, closed, clopen or neither.
>>[!claim|*]- Solution
>>The set is clearly not open. If this was in $\mathbb{R}$, this would be open. But in $\mathbb{R}^2$, a ball would include elements not in $A$. Let us show this rigorously.
>>
>>**Not Open**: Let $\vec x \in A \implies \forall r > 0, B_r(\vec x)$ contains points with $x_2 > 0$. More specifically, $(x_1, \frac{r}{2}) \in B_r(\vec x)$. Thus it is not open.
>>
>>**Not Closed**: We need to show $A^c$ is not open. To do so, let $\bar x = (0,0)$, then for any $r > 0$, let $\widetilde x_1 = min(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{r}{2})$, then $(\widetilde x_1,0) \in B_r(\vec 0) \cap A$. Thus $A^c$ is not open.

>[!exm|2] (Less Rigorous)
>Consider: $$B = \{(x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2: x_2 = x_1^2\}$$Determine if it is open, closed, clopen or neither.
>>[!claim|*]- Solution
>>**Not Open**: Clearly any ball with center on the graph of radius $r$ contains other points not in $B$.
>>**Closed**: It is closed as for any ball not on $B$, we can choose $r$ such that only points in $B^c$ reside in our ball.

>[!proposition|1]
>We propose the following: 
>1. An arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed

>The proof for these can be done using Demorgans’ Laws and the definition of open and closed sets.

We need another definition to determine if something is closed (said alternate definition that we are working towards is in fact the first definition for closure that is introduced in the book).

>[!def|*] Punctured Ball
>Let $\vec x \in \mathbb{R}^d \; \land \; r >0$, then the punctured ball around $\vec x$ is the set: $$\hat B_r(\vec x) = B_r \vec (x) \backslash\{\vec x\}$$In $\mathbb{R}$, we have: $\hat B_r(\vec x) = (x-r,x) \cup (x,x+r)$

>[!def|*] Cluster/ Limit / Accumulation points
>Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$. A point $\vec x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a cluster point of $A$ if: $$\hat B_r(\vec x)\cap A \ne \emptyset$$$\forall \; r > 0$. The set of cluster points of $A$ is denoted $A^{'}$. Some examples:
>- $A = (0,1) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ $\implies A^{‘} = [0,1]$
>- $B = (0,1) \cup \{2\} \implies B^{‘} = [0,1]$ (Clearly a ball around $2$ with sufficiently small $r$ gives the $\emptyset$)

>[!def|*] Isolated Point
>If $x \in A$ is not a cluster point of $A$, it is called an isolated point of $A$. Thus, in the previous example involving $B$, $2$ would be an isolated point. 

>[!proposition|2]
>Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ be finite. Then every $x \in A$ is an isolated point. 
>>[!claim|*]- Rough Proof
>>`\begin{proof}` Let $\vec x \in A$. Let $r = min \{\rho(x,y) : \vec y \ne \vec x\}$. Then $\hat B_r( \vec x)$ contains no points in $A$, and $\therefore$ $x$ is isolated.
>> `\end{proof}`

>[!example|3]
>Consider: $$B = \{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N}_+\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$$Every points in $B$ is isolated since: $$\hat B_{\frac{1}{2n}}(\frac{1}{n})\cap B = \emptyset$$Furthermore, the point $0$ is a cluster point of $B$: $$\forall r > 0 \; \; \hat B_r(0) = (-r,0) \cup (0,r)$$contains an infinite number of points from $B$ by the [[Archimedean Property]].

>[!def|*] Alternate definition of a Closed Set
>A set if closed if and only if it contains all of its cluster points.

>This idea will be expanded next lecture.

>[!def|*] Boundary Point
>Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, then a point $\vec x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a boundary point of $A$ if: $$\forall r> 0 \; \; B_r(\vec x) \cap A \ne \emptyset \; \land \; B_r (\vec x) \cap A^c \ne \emptyset$$

![[Pasted image 20240229171126.png]]
In this image, $B \; \land \; C$ are boundary points (assuming $B \in A$ where $A$ is the set, not point in the image above)

>[!rmk|*]
>1. We use $bd(A)$ to denote the boundary of $A$. Sometimes we use $\partial A$.
>2. If $\vec x \in bd(A)$, doesn’t mean $\vec \in A$. (Ex: $A = (0,1) \implies bd(A) = \{0,1\}$)
>3. $bd(A) = bd(A^c)$

>[!def|*] Interior Point
>Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^d$, a point $\vec x \in A$ is an interior point of $A$ if: $$\exists r>0 \; \;B_r(\vec x) \subseteq A$$
>In other words: $\vec x$ is contained in an open subset of $A$.
>
>We denote the set of interior points of $A$ to be $\text{Int}(A)$. Sometimes, we use $A^0$.

>[!proposition|*] Quiz Question
>The interior of $A$ is the largest open subset of $A$. $\text{Ie}$ If $B \subseteq A$ is open, then $B \subseteq \text{Int}(A)$.
