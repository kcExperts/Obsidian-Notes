>[!definition|*] Countable Sets
>A set $A$ is said to be countable if $\exists \; f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow A:$ $f$ is a [[Bijective|Bijection]]. In other words, a countable set implies $|A| = |\mathbb{N}|$ (They have the same [[Cardinality]])

>[!definition|*] Uncountable Set
>A set $A$ is uncountable is it is not countable. The [[Reals]] are uncountable.
