>[!definition|*] Bounded
A set $A$ is bounded if it has both an Upper and Lower bound.

Upper and lower bounds allow us to define values for subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ such that all values in the set are less than or equal to the upper bound or greater than or equal to the lower bound.

>[!definition|*] Upper and Lower bounds
>- A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is bounded above $\implies \exists \; b \in \mathbb{R} : \forall \; a \in A,\: a \le b \; \lor \; a < b$
>- A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is bounded below $\implies \exists \; l \in \mathbb{R} : \forall \; a \in A, \:l \le a \; \lor \; l<a$

This allows us to define the [[Supremum]] and the [[Infimum]], which brings us a step closer to defining the [[Reals]].
