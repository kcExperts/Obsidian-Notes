By now, we need ways to describe theorems. We note:

>[!def|*] Describing a Sequence
>A sequence $(a_n)$ is:
> - #Nondecreasing if $a_{n+1} \ge a_n \; \forall \; n \in \mathbb{N}$
> - #Nonincreasing if $a_{n+1} \le a_n \; \forall \; n \in \mathbb{N}$
> - #Monotone if it is always increasing or decreasing
>
>Note that $a_n = (-1)^n$ is not monotone.

This leads to an important theorem, the [[Monotone Convergence Theorem]].
