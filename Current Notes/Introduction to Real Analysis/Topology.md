>[!def|*] Topology
>Let $X$ be a set. A topology on $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$, denoted $T$: 
>1. $\emptyset \; \land \; X$ are in $T$.
>2. Any finite intersection of sets in $T$ is in $T$.
>3. Any arbitrary union of sets in $T$ is also in $T$.
>
>We note:
>- If a set is in $T$, we call it an [[Open and Closed Sets|Open]] set.
>- $(X,T)$ is called a topological space.

>[!exm|*]- Topology
>Consider $X = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$. Then we can have: 
>- $T = \{\emptyset, X\}$ is a topology (called the trivial topology on $X$)
>- $T = P(X)$ is a topology (called the discrete topology on $X$)
>- $T = \{ \emptyset, \{1,2\}, \{1\}, \{2\}, X\}$ is a topology.
>
>Note: $P(X)$ is the power set of $X$. 

>[!rmk|*] Metric Topology
>We note that a metric space is an example of a topological space. It just happens to have the metric topology as itâ€™s topology.
