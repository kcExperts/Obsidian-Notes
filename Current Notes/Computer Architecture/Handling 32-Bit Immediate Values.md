As mentioned in [[Implementation of Constants|Immediate Mode]], the [[RISC Instruction Set]] restricts the operand size to $16$-bits. To get around this, the [[Logic Instructions]] `Or` and `OrHigh` can be used in tandem.

>[!rmk|*] Extending to $32$-bit Immediate Values
>If we want to construct a $32$-bit immediate value, we must “merge” two $16$-bit values together into a single register. This is done by using:
>- `OrHigh   R2, R0, ValueFront` followed directly by:
>- `Or  R2, R2, ValueRear`
>
>Where `ValueFront` is the $16$-bit number that represents the “front“ part of the $32$-bit number. `ValueRear` is the rear of the $32$-bit number.

What the operations do is place the $16$-bit specified value in `OrHigh` to the top part of a sequence of $0$’s generated by register 0 (see [[NIOS II Conventions]]). The `Or` part then places the specified $16$-bit value to the lower end. This creates a $32$-bit Immediate value.
