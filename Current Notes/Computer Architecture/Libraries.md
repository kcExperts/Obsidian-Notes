Clearly, [[Subroutines]] that are useful in one program are useful in others. It is common practice to collect all the files with the subroutines into a file stored on the disk. This file is called a Library.

>[!def|*] Library
>A library is a file that contains other subroutine files. An archiver is used to create library files. The library contains all information needed by the linker for it to work as desired. When invoking the linker with a library, the programmer must specify which desired library file they want.
