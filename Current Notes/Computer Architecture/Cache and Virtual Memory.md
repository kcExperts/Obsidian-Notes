The processor can usually process data faster than it can be fetched from main memory. Hence memory access time is usually the main bottleneck in the system. 

>[!def|*] Cache Memory
>Cache memory is small, fast memory inserted between the larger, slower main memory and the processor. It holds currently active portions of a program and their data.

>[!def|*] Virtual Memory
>It is a technique where only the active portions of a program are stored in the main memory, and the rest in larger secondary memory. Sections of the program are continuously moved back and forth between main and secondary storage devices this way.
