To prepare a program, the programmer will use a utility program called a text editor which is saved into a file.

After loading the source file from the disk to memory, an assembler is used.

>[!def|*] Assembly Process
>The assembly process consists of a programmer writing a source file for the code to a secondary memory location. Then the source file is taken into the assembler to decode it into machine instructions (binary) which is then executed.
