>[!def|*] Decoder
>A decoder is a circuit that is used to decode encoded information. One can think of it as the opposite of a [[Multiplexer]]. It takes $n$ inputs and provides $2^n$ outputs (assume $n \ge 2$ or else it would be quite useless). Generally, higher input decoders are built with the basic $2$ to $4$ decoder. Every $2$ to $4$ decoder has an $En$ to choose which input signal will be used.
