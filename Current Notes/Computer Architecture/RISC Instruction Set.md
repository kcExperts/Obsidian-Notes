The Reduced Instruction Set Computers instruction set work on the premise that higher performance is achieved if each instruction occupies exactly one word in memory with all operands already defined in cache memory. 

>[!definition|*] Key Characteristics of RISC
>The two key characteristics are:
>- Each instruction fits in a single word.
>-  A load/store architecture is used:
>	- Memory is accessed using only `load` and `store` instructions.
>	- All operands for arithmetic or logic is already in processor registers.
