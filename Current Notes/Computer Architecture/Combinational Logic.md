>[!def|*] Combinational Logic
>Combinational logic refers to digital circuits or systems where the output is solely determined by the current input values and not influenced by previous inputs or the sequence of input values (hence no [[Flip-Flops]]). 

Combinational logic circuits perform specific Boolean functions and are composed of basic logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR. 

>[!rmk|*] Key Characteristics
>The following are key to combination logic:
> 1. **No Feedback**: There are no feedback loops in combinational logic circuits, meaning that the output does not affect the inputs directly.
> 2. **Instantaneous Output**: The output changes immediately (relative to the speed of the hardware) in response to any change in the input.
> 3. **Truth Tables**: Combinational logic functions can be represented by truth tables.

Common examples of combinational logic include:
- [[Multiplexers]]
- [[Decoders]]
- [[Adders]]
