>[!def|*] Sequential Logic
>Sequential logic, in contrast to [[Combinational Logic]], involves circuits where the output depends on the previous states of the system. Thus these circuits employ memory elements such as [[Flip-Flops]] and latches.

>[!rmk|*] Key Characteristics
>The key characteristics of sequential logic are:
>1. **Memory Elements**: Sequential logic circuits incorporate memory elements such as [[Flip-Flops]] to store information about the past state of the system.
>2. **Feedback Loops**: These circuits have feedback loops, where the output is def back into the system to influence future behavior.
>3. **Clock Signal**: Sequential circuits often use clock signals to synchronize the timing of operations. This ensures that the state transitions occur at specific, well-defined points in time.
>4. **State Diagrams**: Sequential circuits can be represented using state diagrams (see [[State-Machine Principles]]) which illustrate the possible states of the system and the transitions between them based on input conditions and clock pulses.
