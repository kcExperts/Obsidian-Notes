#### Chapter 5 - Basic Processing Unit
>[!rmk|*] Chapter Outline
> - Execution of instructions by a processor (Execution at a detailed level, cycle by cycle with **hardware contributions** and how everything is connected together)
> - Functional units in a processor
> - Interconnection of units
> - Hardware for generating control signals

> Must review some of 271

>[!rmk|*] Fundamental Concepts
>Processing unit executes machine instructions and coordinates activities of other units. The term CPU is an old term, there is no central processing unit anymore, instead we have multiple processing units inside of a computer. Thus we use the term `processor`. 
>
>Memory holds machine-instruction programs. The processor fetches one instruction at a time. The program counter points to the next instruction. The PC is then incremented or set to branch. As each instruction is fetched from memory, it is placed in the IR. Control circuitry decodes IR contents to dictate internal/external operations for processor to complete execution of instruction.
