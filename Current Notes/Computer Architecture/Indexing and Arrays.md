>[!definition|*] Index Mode
>The effective address (EA) of the operand is generated by adding a constant value to the contents of a register, denoted: $$\text{X(Ri)}$$
>In the case where $\text{X}$ is not specified, it takes on the value $0$. The effective address is calculated by: $$\text{EA} = \text{X} + [\text{Ri}]$$

Contents of a register are not changed when generating the effective address. Indexes are also very useful when working with lists.
