In general, Physical mem. capacity $\le$ address space size. A large program or many active programs may not be entirely resident in the main memory. Thus, secondary storage is used to hold portions exceeding memory capacity. Needed portions are automatically loaded into the memory, replacing other portions.

Implementation of virtual memory relies on the memory management unit (MMU). It maintains virtual to physical address mapping.
