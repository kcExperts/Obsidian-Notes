Unless you become the owner of the company by amassing many stocks of the company, then the value in holding stocks comes from dividends and any growth in the stock’s value.

>[!def|*] Dividends
>Dividends are lump sum payments, paid out every quarter or every six months, to the holder of the stock. 
>- The amount depends on the board of directors of the company and is usually set a month or so before the dividend is paid.
>- Not all companies offer dividends.
>- They are often treated as taxable income.

Now there exists a data for when the dividend is announced that if the stock is sold, the dividend will still go to the previous owner. Usually, during this period, the stock’s value will go down to offset the new owner not getting the dividend. 

Often capital gains due to the rise in a stock price are taxed differently from a dividend.
