>[!def|*] Exchange Rate
>The exchange rate is the rate of which one currency can be exchanged for another.

Some currencies are pegged to another and others are allowed to float freely. There must be consistency to avoid arbitrage profits.

>[!rmk|*]
>As usual, fluctuations are impossible to predict, but:
>- There is a link between exchange rates and the [[Interest]] rate in the two countries. Central banks use this to manipulate exchange rates, but only to a degree.
>- Higher interest rates tend to attract foreign investment, increasing the demand for and the value of the home countryâ€™s currency.
