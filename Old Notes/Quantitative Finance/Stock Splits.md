>[!def|*] Stock Splits
>A stock split is a decision by the companyâ€™s board to increase the number of outstanding shares in the company. This is done by issuing new [[Equities|Shares]] to shareholders in a set proportion. The most common are: 
>- 2-for-1
>- 3-for-2
>- 3-for-1
>
>This is usually done for psychological effect. You are more likely to trade many shares priced cheaply rather than one very expensive share.

>[!exm|*]
>Suppose you own $10$ shares of $\$100$ each. A 2-for-1 split would leave you with $20$ shares at $\$50$ each.
