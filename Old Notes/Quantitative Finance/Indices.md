There is no one perfect way to calculate the weighing method for the index. Thus multiple methods were created. The main ones are listed below.
#### Index Weighting Methods
The most common is the Capitalization Weighting

>[!def|*]- Price Weighting
>In a price-weighted index, each component index (which can be thought of as aa companies stock price) is weighted according to its current share price. The formula is as follows: $$\text{Weight} = \frac{P_i}{P_1 + \dots +P_n}$$Where if I had $4$ companies with stock prices: $A = \$5, B =\$10, C = \$20, D = \$15$. Then their weight would be as follows:$A = 10\%, B = 20\%, C = 40\%, D = 30\%$.

>It is to be noted that [[Stock Splits]] will affect the weighting, thus recalculations must be done every time companies decide to split stock.

#### Example of Indices
>[!rmk|*] Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
>The S&P500 takes the average of the stocks of the $500$ biggest companies in the U.S. 
>- If people say the “market” is up, then they are usually referring to the S&P500.
>- Usually, people will use the term “points” when discussing if the S&P500 has gained or lost value.

>[!rmk|*] NASDAQ
>Made out of about $3000$ stocks. It is not used as the standard as it is made out of mostly tech-related stocks.

>[!rmk|*] Dow Jones Industrial Average
>The Dow Jones is similar to the S&P500 except that it only considers the $30$ biggest compagnies in the united states. It is one of the oldest equity indices.
