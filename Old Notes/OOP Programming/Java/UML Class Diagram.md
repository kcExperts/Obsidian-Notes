>[!def|*]- UML Class Diagram
>A UML class diagram describes the structure of a class. It includes the name of the class and:
>- Its [[Java Fields]] (called attributes)
>- Its [[Java Method|Methods]] (called operations)
>
>The simplest class diagram requires just the name of the class in box. The name is centered and the first letter capitalized.

>If fields need to be shown, then a compartment below the name is made and the access modifier, followed by the field name and type (left justified) is placed in the box. Access modifiers are: 
>- `+` represents [[Public]]
>- `-` represents [[Private]]
>- `~` represents [[Package]] [[Private]]
>- `#` represents [[Protected]]

>Should methods need to be added, they are shown in a compartment below the fields. They are in the form of the access modifier, followed by the method name, then the parameter list and lastly the return type. Parameters are specified as *name : type*. Constructors can be included as well and as always, everything is left justified.
