In general, a data type is an attribute of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. Types in Java are separated into two parts:

#### Primitive Types
In Java, primitive types directly write to memory. They consist of the standard:
- [[Integer in Coding|int]]
- [[Floating-Point Number|float]]
- [[Floating-Point Number|double]]
- [[char]]
- [[Boolean]]
Only the most basic of types are primitive.
#### Reference Types
In Java, reference types store memory addresses of specific objects. The ``String`` type is special as it is the only reference type that is immutable. The following are all reference data types in Java:
- [[Wrapper Class]]
- [[Arrays]] (Although it does not need to use a Wrapper Class)
- [[String]]
- [[Interface]]
- [[Enumeration]]
