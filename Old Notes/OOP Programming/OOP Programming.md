>[!def|*]- Philosophy of designing a program
>1. **Define your goal**: Ideally, you should be able to state this in a sentence or two.
>2. **Define requirements**: Essentially the constraints of your solution.
>3. **Define your tools, targets, and backup plan**: Remember to backup your work!
>4. **Break hard problems down into easy problems**: Complex problems are everywhere. In such cases, we use the top down method. We break a task into multiple subtasks which are easier to solve. 
>5. **Figure out the sequence of events**: Organize the order of the subtasks and have a plan on how you will write your code.
>6. **Implementation 1**: Outline the main function with comments (outline your program).
>7. **Implementation 2**: Implement every function.
>8. **Implementation 3**: Final testing.
>
>Words of advice:
>- Keep your starting program simple.
>- **Add features over time**.
>- Focus on one area at a time.
>- Test each piece of code as you go.
>- Optimize for maintainability, not performance.
