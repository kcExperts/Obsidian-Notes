In the study of probability theory, the relation between different events of an experiment play (an obviously) central role. For the following definitions, let an [[Sample Space|Event]] $E$, $F$ and $G$ belong to a fixed [[Sample Space]] $S$.

>[!def|*] Subset
>$E$ is said to be a subset of $F$ if when $E$ occurs, $F$ occurs as well. Denoted $E \subseteq F$.

>[!def|*] Equality
>$E$ and $F$ are equal if $E \subseteq F$ and $F \subseteq E$ holds true. We denote equality as $E = F$.

>[!def|*] Intersection
>$G$ is said to be an intersection of $E$ and $F$ if it occurs only when $E$ and $F$ both occur. We denote it $G = E \cap F$ or by $G = EF$.

>[!def|*] Union
>$G$ is said to be a union of $E$ and $F$ if it occurs whenever either $E$ or $F$ (or both) occur. We denote it $G = E \cup F$.

>[!def|*] Complement
>$G$ is called the complement of $E$ if $G$ occurs whenever $E$ does not occur. We denote the complement as: $G = E^c$

>[!def|*] Difference
>$G$ is called the difference of $E$ and $F$ if it occurs when $E$ occurs but $F$ does not. We denote it as: $G = E-F$. 
>
>We note $E^c = S - E \; \land \; E-F = EF^c$.

>[!def|*] Certainty
>An event is called certain if its occurrence is inevitable. Hence $S$ is a certain event.

>[!def|*] Impossibility
>An event is impossible if there is certainty in its nonoccurrence. Thus $\emptyset = S^c$ is an impossible event.

>[!def|*] Mutually Exclusiveness
>If the joint occurrence of $E$ and $F$ is impossible, then $E$ and $F$ are mutually exclusive. Hence: $EF = E \cap F = \emptyset$.

A useful notion is that $S = E \cup E^c \; \land \; E= ES$.
