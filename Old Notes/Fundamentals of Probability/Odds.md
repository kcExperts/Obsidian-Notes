>[!rmk|*] Odds
>In the real world, we express probability in terms of odds. We say: 
>- **Odds in favor of an event A are r to s if:**  $$P(A) = \frac{r}{r+s}$$ 
>- **Odds are against an event A are r to s if**:$$P(S) = \frac{s}{r+s}$$
>
>In essence, if the odds of $A$ is $r$ to $s$, then the odds against $A$ are $s$ to $r$. Also: $P(A) = p \implies P(A^c) = 1-p$.
