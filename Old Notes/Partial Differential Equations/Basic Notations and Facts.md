Here we specify symbols and notations that will be constantly used:

#### Sets and Topology

>[!claim|]- Unit Vectors
Denote $e^1, \dots, e^n$ as the unit vectors in the canonical base in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In $\mathbb{R}^2 \; \land \; \mathbb{R}^3$, they may be denoted by **i**, **j**, and **k**.

>[!claim]- Open Ball
>Let $B_r(x)$ denote the [[Open and Closed Sets|open]] [[The r Ball|ball]] in $\mathbb{R}^n$. If there is no need to specify the radius, then $B(x)$ is used.
>- The volume of $B_r(x)$ is: $$|B_r| = \frac{\omega_n}{n}r^n$$
>- The area of $B_r(x)$ is: $$|\partial B_r| = \omega_n r^{n-1}$$
>  
>  Where $\omega_n$ is the surface area of the unit sphere $\partial B_1$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$; in particular $\omega_2 = 2 \pi \; \land \; \omega_3 = 4 \pi$. 
>Note that in general: $$w_n = \frac{n \pi^{\frac{n}{2}}}{\Gamma \left( \frac{1}{2}n+1 \right) }$$Where: $$\Gamma(s) = \int_0^{+\infty}t^{s-1}e^{-t} dt$$Is the [[Euler Gamma Function]].

>[!claim|3]- General Notions
>The following should be known:
>- [[Interior Points|Interior Point]]
>- [[Boundary Points|Boundary Point]] which will be denoted by $\partial A$ for a set $A$.
>- [[Cluster Points|Limit Point]] (also called the [[Cluster Points|Cluster Point]])
>- [[Open and Closed Sets|Open]]
>- [[Open and Closed Sets|Closed]]
>- [[Closure]] (we will use $\overline A = A \cup \partial A$)
>- [[Infimum]]
>- [[Supremum]]
>- [[Continuity]]
>- [[Continuous Function]]
>- [[Continuous of Order k]]
>- [[Uniform Convergence]]
>- [[Weierstrass M-test]]
>- [[Integration and Differentiation of Power Series]]
>- [[Bounds|Bounded]]
>- [[Compact]]
>- [[Lipschitz]]

>[!claim|4]- Connected, Domain, Dense 
>- An open set $A$ is connected if $\:\forall x,y \in A, \exists$ a regular curve joining them entirely contained in $A$. 
>- A domain is an open connected set denoted by $\Omega$.
>- If $U \subset A$, $U$ is dense in $A$ if $\overline U = A$. Hence any point $x \in A$ is a limit point of $U$. For instance, $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.
