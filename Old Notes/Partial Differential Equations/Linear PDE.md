#### Definition
>[!def|1] Linear PDE
>A PDE is called linear if $F$ is linear with respect to $u$ and all its derivatives, otherwise it is [[Nonlinear PDE|Nonlinear]].

>[!exm]- Examples between types of PDE’s
>Consider the following equations:
>1. The following is **linear**. $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1} +\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2} = 0$$
>2. The following is **nonlinear**. $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1} + \left(  \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1} \right) ^2 = 0$$
>3. The following is **nonlinear**. $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2} + u^2 = 0$$

The following linear equations are all fundamental and their theory constitutes a starting point for many equations:
- [[Transport Equation]]
- [[Diffusion Equation]]
- [[Wave Equation]]
- [[Laplace’s Equation]]
- [[Black-Scholes Equation]]
- [[Vibrating Plate]]
- [[Schrödinger Equation]]
