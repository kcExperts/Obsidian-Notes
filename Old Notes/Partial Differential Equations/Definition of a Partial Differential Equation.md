>[!def|1] Partial Differential Equation
>A partial differential equation (PDE) is a relation of the following type:$$F(x_1, \dots, x_n, u, u_{x_1}, \dots,u_{x_n},u_{x_1x_1}, u_{x_1x_2}. \dots , u_{x_nx_n}, u_{x_1x_1x_1}, \dots) = 0$$Where $u = u(x_1, \dots , x_n)$ is a function of $n$ variables and $u_{x_j}, \dots, u_{x_ix_j}, \dots$ are its partial derivative.

>[!rmk|*]- On the topic of notation
>Normally, for a multivariable function $f(x,y)$, its partial derivative $\frac{\partial f} {\partial x}$ is equivalently written as $f_x$. So in the above definition of a PDE, $u_{x_ix_j}$ denotes $\frac{\partial^2 f} {\partial x_i \partial x_j}$.

We distinguish between [[Linear PDE]] and a [[Nonlinear PDE]].

>For the notes, unless otherwise stated:
>- $x$ represents a space variable (usually in dimension $n = 1,2,3$)
>- $t$ represents the time variable
