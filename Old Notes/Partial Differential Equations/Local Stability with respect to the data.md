In mathematical models, general laws of continuum mechanics (laws of conservation) are relevant while others may be omitted through assumptions and simplifications. In general, additional information is necessary to select or predict the existence of a unique solution. This is usually given in terms of initial/ or boundary data.

The use of initial conditions or boundary data is to ensure one of the following: 
1. There exists at least one solution;
2. There exists at most one solution;
3. The solution depends continuously on the data.

>[!rmk|*] Explaining the third point
>Roughly speaking, the third point translate to: $$\text{data} \implies \text{solution}$$
>is a continuous relationship. Hence a small error on the data entails a small error on the solution. The notion of error is understood using distance.

A problem that possesses properties $1,2,3$ are said to be well posed. It is sometimes useful, maybe essential, to deal with well posed problems: existence of the solution indicates that the model is coherent.
